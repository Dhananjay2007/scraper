Mitigations and Workarounds 
Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations, if possible. Additionally, we encourage customers to implement our suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability. 

Restrict Access to Built-in Verve Account
Access to the built-in ""verve"" account should be limited to only administrators who need to perform administrative functions and should only be used for administrative purposes. Separate accounts should be used for day-to-day functions.
Change the password for the built-in ""verve"" account if it has been shared.


Restrict Privileges for Other Accounts
Verve Reporting comes with built-in roles to simplify the delegation of user permissions. Assigning a user the following two roles will allow them access to most Verve Reporting features (excluding user administration), but will not give them permission to execute this vulnerability.
all-all
feature-all-all




Disable Machine Learning
Machine learning can be disabled in the Elasticsearch configuration override. Contact Verve support for assistance if needed.
Connect to the Reporting server via SSH or terminal.
Copy the Elasticsearch configuration override to the working directory.
docker exec $(docker ps --filter ""name=Reporting_elasticsearch"" --format ""{{ .ID }}"") cat /usr/share/elasticsearch/config-templates/elasticsearch.override.yml > elasticsearch.override.yml


Add the following line and save.
xpack.ml.enabled: false


Disable Verve Reporting from the Verve Software Manager.
Update the Elasticsearch configuration override.
docker config rm elasticsearchymloverride 
docker config create elasticsearchymloverride ./elasticsearch.override.yml


Enable Verve Reporting from the Verve Software Manager and confirm that the application starts and ""Machine Learning"" is no longer listed in the main navigation bar under Analytics.

Mitigations and Workarounds 
Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply security best practices, if possible.

By default, all HMI server projects are saved in the HMI projects folder on the HMI server computer located at C:\Users\Public\Documents\RSView Enterprise\SE\HMI projects. To enhance security and prevent unauthorized modifications to these projects, you can tighten the Windows folder's security settings on the HMI server computer by following these steps:
Remove the INTERACTIVE group from the folder’s security properties.
Add specific users or user groups and assign their permissions to this folder as needed.
If you assign read-only permission to those users or user groups, they can only view and will not be able to write to project files. Users with read-only permission can still test run and run the FactoryTalk® View SE client.


In Version 14: Open FactoryTalk® View Studio -> Help -> FactoryTalk® View SE Help -> In the Help file -> Security -> “HMI projects folder”

Mitigations and Workarounds
Users using the affected software are encouraged to implement the following steps to invalidate the existing vulnerable private keys/digital certificates and regenerate new secure ones.
·       Clear CIP Security configurations from devices and from FactoryTalk® Policy Manager
·       Update FactoryTalk® System Services and FactoryTalk® Policy Manager to v6.40.01
·       Redeploy CIP Security Policy 
Detailed steps are below (FactoryTalk System Services (FTSS) is updated through the installation of FactoryTalk Policy Manager (FTPM)
1)      Remove deployed security policy from all devices using FactoryTalk® Policy Manager (FTPM):
a.       Open FTPM.
b.       Document all Zone’s security settings and all Conduit’s settings as you must re-create them after updating FTPM.
c.       Change all devices port’s Policies > Zone values to the “Unassigned” Zone.
d.       Delete all zones and conduits.
e.       Deploy (CIP).  Ensure that all endpoints were reset successfully.
f.        [migrating from v6.40 only] Deploy (OPC UA).  Ensure all endpoints were reset successfully.
                                                               i.      For any OPC UA clients, perform whatever steps are required by those clients to remove the previously applied certificates.
g.       Close FTPM
2)      Delete the \FTSS_backup folder:
a.       c:\ProgramData\Rockwell\RNAServer\Global\RnaStore\FTSS_Backup
3)      Delete the \keystore folder:

Due to heightened geopolitical tensions and adversarial cyber activity globally, Rockwell Automation is issuing this notice urging all customers to take IMMEDIATE action to assess whether they have devices facing the public internet and, if so, urgently remove that connectivity for devices not specifically designed for public internet connectivity.
Consistent with Rockwell Automation’s guidance for all devices not specifically designed for public internet connectivity (for example, cloud and edge offerings), users should never configure their assets to be directly connected to the public-facing internet. Removing that connectivity as a proactive step reduces attack surface and can immediately reduce exposure to unauthorized and malicious cyber activity from external threat actors.
More information on attacks on public-internet-exposed assets, including information on how to identify exposed assets and disconnect them from the public internet, is available in these documents from Rockwell Automation and CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):

In addition to disconnecting assets from the public internet or if disconnection is not feasible, Rockwell Automation also urges its customers to follow the security best practices outlined in this document: Rockwell Automation | Security Best Practices [login required].
Customers should be aware of the following related CVE’s and ensure mitigations are in place, where possible.

Mitigations and Workarounds
Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply the risk mitigations, if possible. Additionally, we encourage customers to implement our suggested security best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerability.
Customers updating to v6.40 or later should do one of the following steps:

Set the FactoryTalk Directory’s System Communications Type security policy to SOCKET.IO. This prevents FactoryTalk Services Platform from using the DCOM communication channel. When set to SOCKET.IO only v6.40, and later, FactoryTalk Directory clients can communicate with the FactoryTalk Directory server.


If the v6.40 (or later) FactoryTalk Directory server must support communication with legacy FactoryTalk Directory client versions, v6.31 and earlier, do not alter the System Communication Type setting from AUTO or DCOM.
Instead, elevate DCOM Authentication Level to PACKET PRIVACY (‘6’). Please refer to Mitigating Microsoft DCOM Hardening Patch (CVE-2021-26414) for Affected Rockwell Automation Products (custhelp.com)

IMPORTANT! Two v 6.40 (or later) FactoryTalk Directory security policies can prevent legacy FactoryTalk Directory clients, v6.31 and earlier, from connecting with the FactoryTalk Directory server. Ensure both security policies are set to Legacy to allow the connection.
The two security policies are the Service Token signature method and Encryption method.
Customers who are unable to update to v6.40 or later should apply the following mitigations:

Set DCOM authentication level to 6, which enables encryption of the service token and communication channel between the server and client. Please refer to Mitigating Microsoft DCOM Hardening Patch (CVE-2021-26414) for Affected Rockwell Automation Products (custhelp.com)
When it is not possible to update to v6.40 or later, enable verification of the publisher information (i.e., digital signature) of any executable attempting to use the FactoryTalk® Services APIs. This helps prevent a malicious user from calling the API to receive the service token. This setting can be changed from the Application Authorization node located within System Policies using the FactoryTalk® Administration Console application.

We are not aware of current exploitation leveraging this capability, and intended victimization remains unclear. Previous threat actors cyberactivity involving industrial systems suggests a high likelihood that these capabilities were developed with an intent to target critical infrastructure and that victim scope could include international customers. Threat activity is subject to change and customers using affected products could face serious risk if exposed.  Rockwell Automation has provided patches for all affected products, including hardware series that were out of support. Detection rules have also been provided.  Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to gain remote access of the running memory of the module and perform malicious activity, such as manipulating the module’s firmware, inserting new functionality into the module, wiping the module’s memory, falsifying traffic to/from the module, establishing persistence on the module, and potentially affect the underlying industrial process. This could result in destructive actions where vulnerable modules are installed, including critical infrastructure.  Customers using the affected products are strongly encouraged to evaluate and implement the mitigations provided below. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerabilities, including the products in scope, impact, and recommended countermeasures, are provided below.

Once the module is updated to signed firmware (example 5.008 to 5.029), it is not possible to revert to unsigned firmware versions.  Mitigations  Organizations should take the following actions to further secure ControlLogix communications modules from exploitation.   Update firmware. Update EN2* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 11.004 and update EN4* ControlLogix communications modules to firmware revision 5.002.   Properly segment networks. Given a cyber actor would require network connectivity to the communication module to exploit the vulnerability, organizations should ensure ICS/SCADA networks are properly segmented within the process structure as well as from the Internet and other non-essential networks.   Implement detection signatures. Use appended Snort signatures to monitor and detect anomalous Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets to Rockwell Automation devices.   Additionally, organizations should increase protections of ICS/SCADA networks by implementing at least the following mitigations:  Regularly back up devices to allow for reversion to a clean copy of firmware or a working project; disable unused CIP objects on communications modules, such as unused CIP Email and Socket Objects;  block all traffic to CIP-enabled devices from outside the ICS/SCADA network using available security products; and monitor CIP traffic for unexpected content or unusual packets lengths.   Potential Indicators of Compromise  System owners should ensure ICS/SCADA networks are baselined and regularly monitored for deviations in network activity. Specifically, systems owners can look for the following potential IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) for ControlLogix communications modules:  Unknown scanning on a network for Common Industrial Protocol (CIP)-enabled devices. Unexpected or out-of-specification CIP packets to CIP objects implemented in ControlLogix communications modules, including the Email Object and non-public vendor-specified objects. Arbitrary writes to communication module memory or firmware. Unexpected firmware updates. Unexpected disabling of secure boot options. Uncommon firmware file names.   Detection Rules  The following Snort rules are intended to be run on a computer with network visibility of a ControlLogix communications module and can be used to detect traffic to a ControlLogix communications module that does not conform to the CIP specification as provided by ODVA (Open DeviceNet Vendors Association). While both the CIP Email and Socket Objects are capable of communicating over a network, they are intended to communicate over the backplane of a ControlLogix PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and therefore should not be seen over the network. However, it is possible that site engineers could configure a communications module such that there is legitimate network traffic to and from CIP Email and Socket Objects, potentially resulting in false positives.  Snort 2 Rules and Snort 3 Rules are both attached below.

Version supports use of .NET Remoting (system default) with connections restricted to a local port; mitigating the vulnerability.            Product Family   Suggested Actions       FactoryTalk Services Platform V2.00 – V6.11   We have provided guidance for customers affected by this vulnerability to assess whether the service is installed, and steps for implementing the recommended mitigations. Customers should consider implementing the following measures based on their needs:  Upgrade to FactoryTalk Services Platform V6.31. Recommended action for versions that predate v6.20 upgrade to version 6.20 or later; this version restricts connection settings to only the local port. If it is not possible to update: Alternately for versions 2.74, 2.80, 2.81, 2.90, 3.00, 6.10, or 6.11, install the patch at BF24822 - Patch: FactoryTalk Diagnostics Local Reader service connection settings restricted to local access only, FactoryTalk Services 6.11, 6.10, 3.00, 2.90, 2.80, 2.81, 2.74 to restrict connections settings to only the local port. For versions that predate v2.74 it is recommended to upgrade to a more recent version. Disable the Remote Diagnostics Service if this service is not in use. Disabling this service does not result in data loss. If the service is in use, use Windows Firewall configuration to help prevent remote connection to the effected port. Steps to perform both solutions can be found in Risk mitigation for FactoryTalk Diagnostics remoting endpoint.   Note: A Snort rule for this issue is available in Snort’s developer rules (sid: 32474).          General Security Guidelines   Network-based Vulnerability Mitigations for Embedded Products  Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that .NET Remoting from unauthorized sources are blocked. Ensure that software-based firewalls are running with current rule sets and enforced on individual systems. Consider implementing network security protocols for software systems, such as IPSec. Documentation is available in QA46277 - Deploying FactoryTalk Software with IPsec, outlining guidelines for implementing IPSec with FactoryTalk applications.  Software/PC-based Mitigation Strategies  Use of Microsoft® AppLocker or other similar whitelisting application can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available in QA17329 - Using Rockwell Automation Software Products with AppLocker. Ensure that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.  General Mitigations  Use trusted software, software patches antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites and attachments. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see PN715 - Advisory on web search tools that identify ICS devices and systems connected to the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.   For further information on the Vulnerability Handling Process for Rockwell Automation, please refer to our Product Security Incident Response FAQ document. See our Industrial Network Architectures Page for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to complement security solutions. See the Network Services Overview Page for information on network and security services for Rockwell Automation to enable assessment, design, implementation and management of validated, secure network architectures.

General Security Guidelines

 Network-based Vulnerability Mitigations for Embedded Products
Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that ICMPv4, TCP, ARP and DNS traffic originating from unauthorized sources is blocked.
Ensure that software-based firewalls are running with current rule sets and enforced on individual systems.


Software/PC-based Mitigation Strategies
Use of Microsoft® AppLocker or other similar whitelisting application can help mitigate risk.  Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation® products is available at QA17329 - Using Rockwell Automation Software Products with AppLocker
Ensure that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.


General Mitigations 
Use trusted software, software patches antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted websites
and attachments.
Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article ID PN715 - Advisory on web search tools that identify ICS devices and systems connected to the Internet
Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

,CVE-2022-1159,High,High,,"Revision History       Revision History    Version 1.0 – March 31, 2022 Version 1.1 – May 06, 2022 – Updated vulnerability details and mitigations       Detailed Information    Claroty, a cybersecurity technology vendor and partner of Rockwell Automation, disclosed a vulnerability in Studio 5000 Logix Designer® software which impacts some Logix controllers. Claroty found that the Logix Designer application could allow an unauthorized third-party to inject controller code using a compromised workstation where the third party has gained administrative access. This could allow a third party to download the modified program to the controller and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution on the controller in a way that would potentially be undetectable to a user. This vulnerability was found by Sharon Brizinov and Tal Keren of Claroty, and they have provided a blog post with more details located here .      Affected Products    Studio 5000 Logix Designer application v28 and later, and the following Logix controllers running these versions:  ControlLogix® 5580 controllers GuardLogix® 5580 controllers CompactLogix™ 5380 controllers CompactLogix 5480 controllers Compact GuardLogix 5380 controllers       Vulnerability Details   [CVE-2022-1159]: Modification of PLC Program Code Studio 5000 Logix Designer compiles the user program on the workstation.  This compilation process prepares the Logix Designer application user program for download to a Logix controller. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first gain administrator access to the workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer.  The attacker can then intercept the compilation process and inject code into the user program.   The user may potentially be unaware that this modification has taken place.  This exploit could also allow modification of source key protected content and license source protected content. Changes to the content may not be noticeable to the user. Additionally, exploitation could affect safety tasks if unlocked and signature unprotected at the time of the attack. A locked and signature protected safety task would not be impacted.  CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.7/HIGH CVSS Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H      Risk Mitigation & User Action    There is no long-term mitigation for this vulnerability.

Vulnerability Details

CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not help protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints
Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0, this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10/10 [Critical]
CVSS v3.1 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVE-2021-45046: Apache Log4j2 Thread Context Message Pattern and Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup to true do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 3.7/10 [Moderate]
CVSS V3.1 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
CVE-2021-4104: JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data

JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.1/10 [High]

CVE-2019-17571: Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data

Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget when listening to untrusted network traffic for log data. This affects Log4j versions up to 1.2 up to 1.2.17.

Since ISaGRAF 5 Runtime is provided to a customer as a development kit, implementing least-privilege may vary from implementation to implementation based on the hardware in use.

For AADvance controllers, Customers should update to version 1.041.3 to mitigate vulnerability.

For Micro800 family, to reduce risk, customers are encouraged to help protect the controller with a password. Additionally, customers deploying Micro870®, Micro850®, or Micro830® controllers are encouraged to put the controller's mode switch to ""RUN"". Customers are encouraged to restrict or block traffic on TCP 44818 from outside the industrial control system network zone.

Customers should also confirm they are employing proper network segmentation and security controls. Specifically, network exposure for all control system devices should be minimized, and control systems should be behind firewalls and isolated from other networks when possible.

General Security Guidelines


Use proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that any communication protocols from unauthorized sources are blocked.
Block traffic to all protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to ports using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports, refer to the product documentation.
Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.
Use of Microsoft® AppLocker or other similar allow list application can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at Knowledgebase Article QA17329 - Using Rockwell Automation Software Products with AppLocker.
Confirm that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.
Do not open untrusted .isasln and .acfproj files with ISaGRAF6 Workbench.
Do not click on or open URL links from untrusted sources.
Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.
Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments.
Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article PN715 - Advisory on web search tools that identify ICS devices and systems connected to the Internet.
Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

Vulnerability Details   CVE-2014-0755: Insufficiently Protected Credentials A vulnerability exists in RSLogix 5000 and Studio 5000 Logix Designer that, when exploited, may allow a local, unauthenticated attacker to access and modify project files that are password protected using Source Key Protection and, in some instances, may expose those passwords. Project files include files with the ACD, L5X, or L5K extensions. Successful exploitation will not directly disrupt the operation of Rockwell Automation programmable controllers or other devices in the control system.  CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.3 CVSS v2 Vector: AV:L/AC:M/AU:N/C:C/I:C/A:N      Risk Mitigation & User Action    Customers using the affected software versions are encouraged to update to an available software revision that addresses the associated risk. Customers who are unable to update are directed toward the risk mitigation strategies provided below and are encouraged, when possible, to combine these tactics with the general security guidelines to employ multiple strategies simultaneously.    Vulnerability Details Recommended User Actions   CVE-2014-0755 Risk Mitigation Strategy A:  For stronger protection, apply License Source Protection introduced in v26.   To apply License Source Protection to content that is protected with Source Key Protection, the Source Key Protection must be removed prior to applying License Source Protection. Once content is protected with License Source Key, it must be downloaded to the appropriate controller to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability. Refer to Logix 5000 Controllers Security, 1756-PM016O-EN-P (rockwellautomation.com) for more information about Source Protection  Risk Mitigation Strategy B: In addition to using current software, we also recommend the following actions to concerned customers who continue to use Source Key Protection. Where possible:  Adopt a practice to track creation and distribution of protected ACD files, including duplicates and derivates that contain protected content if these files may need to be found or potentially disposed of in the future.   Securely archive project files that contain content password protected with Source Key Protection in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. For instance, store project files that use Source Key Protection in physical and logical locations where access can be controlled, and the files are stored in a protected and potentially encrypted manner.   Securely transmit project files that contain content password protected with Source Key Protection in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. For instance, email stored project files that use Source Key Protection only to known recipients and encrypt the files such that only the target recipient can decrypt the content.   Restrict the physical network access to controllers containing password protected content only to authorized parties to help prevent unauthorized uploading of protected material in an ACD file. Note: For some customers, FactoryTalk Security software may be a suitable option to assist customers with applying a role-based access control solution to their system. FactoryTalk Security was integrated into RSLogix 5000 v10.00 and above.    Adopt a password management practice to periodically change passwords applied to routines and Add-On Instructions to help mitigate the risk that a learned password may remain useable for an extended period or indefinitely.        IMPORTANT: Files with Source Key Protection password protected content that have been opened and updated using v20.03 software and above will no longer be compatible with earlier versions of the software. For example, a v20.01 project file with password protected content that has been opened and re-saved using v20.03 software can only be opened with v20.03 software and higher. Also, a v21.00 project file with protected content that has been opened and re-saved using v21.03 software can only be opened with v21.03 and higher versions of software.   For the procedure to update older project files to v20.03 (or later), refer to the FAQ for V20.03 at KnowledgeBase ID: IN64.       General Security Guidelines   Software/PC-based Mitigation Strategies The following Software/PC Mitigations may be appropriate to include when the vulnerability is within a software product running on a PC:   Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.

,,N/A,PN1534,,"Revision History       Revision Number    1.0      Revision History    Version 1.0 - October 30, 2020. Initial Release.       Executive Summary    Rockwell Automation’s PSIRT received a report from Amazon regarding a weakness on the Stratix 5700 switch. This weakness is a result of HTTP session management not being a feature of classic Cisco IOS. This may result in unauthenticated access to the web interface if an attacker gains access to the authenticated user’s computer after the “Logout” button has been selected. Rockwell Automation’s PSIRT has collaborated with the Cisco PSIRT to inform customers of this weakness. While this button’s function may lead the user to believe the session is being cleared, the product specifications do not advertise HTTP session management as a function. Both PSIRTs, to be transparent, see the importance of sharing this issue along with potential mitigation options.  Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to evaluate the mitigations provided below and apply the appropriate mitigations to their deployed products.      Affected Products    Allen‑Bradley Stratix 5700 Industrial Managed Ethernet Switches –  All Cisco IOS releases (with the exception of those which incorporate the new HTTP session management feature added through Cisco BugID CSCvo20762) lack HTTP and HTTPS session management capabilities.  Details On the Stratix 5700 Industrial Managed Ethernet switch running Cisco IOS , because no session management is performed for HTTP or HTTP sessions, the only way to close and terminate an active HTTP or HTTPS management session is to close the web browser used for this session after the user is done. Closing the active tab or active window is not enough - the browser instance must be terminated.  If the browser instance has not been terminated, an actor with local access to the machine from which the session was established may be able to restart the management session without being prompted for any credentials, which would result in this actor having the same kind of access to the device as the user on the previous session.      Risk Mitigation & User Action    As of 26-OCT-2020, the following releases incorporate the new HTTP session management code: 15.9(3)M2, 15.9(3)M2a and 15.2(7)E3. Going forward, it is the intention of Cisco for this HTTP session management feature to be implemented in all future Cisco IOS classic releases.  If HTTP session management is desired while running a release which does not support the enhancement, Cisco IOS customers are directed towards risk mitigation. They are encouraged, when possible, to combine this guidance with the general security guidelines for a comprehensive defense in depth strategy.   Completing the following precautionary measure is recommended as a risk mitigation strategy against unauthenticated attackers.  Terminate the browser when finished – closing the tab or window is NOT enough        General Security Guidelines   Software/PC-based Mitigation Strategies  Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system. Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar Whitelisting application can help mitigate risk.  Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at Knowledgebase Article ID QA17329. Ensure that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum amount of rights as needed.

,,N/A,PN923,File Name; Allenbradleyupload.zip; SHA-1; SHA-256; Allenbradleyupload.exe; SHA-1; SHA-256,"Introduction    Claims of ransomware masquerading as an Allen‑Bradley Update      Description   begin ignore      Version 2.0 - July 8th 2016 Rockwell Automation has learned about the existence of a malicious file called ""Allenbradleyupload.zip"" that is being distributed on the internet. This file is NOT an official update from Rockwell Automation, and we have been informed that this file contains a type of ransomware malware that, if successfully installed and launched, may compromise the victim’s computer. This advisory is intended to raise awareness to control system owners and operators of reports of the file’s existence as a result of reports Rockwell Automation received from the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (""E-ISAC""). Update 08-JUL-2016: Our investigation has confirmed the existence of the reported malware through VirusTotal.com. According to VirusTotal, it ""is a free service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs and facilitates the quick detection of viruses, worms, trojans, and all kinds of malware."" According to information on VirusTotal.com, the file ""Allenbradleyupload.zip"" contains a single file called ""Allenbradleyupload.exe"", which may be malicious. File hashes and links to VirusTotal.com are in the table that follows below. These file hash values can be used with Application Whitelisting technologies to reduce the ability of this malware to execute on a system. According to VirusTotal, most of the antivirus/anti-malware vendors have updated their databases to detect this malware.

Rockwell Automation decided to provide this advisory since the attackers have used the Rockwell Automation brand name on the file, possibly as a means to increase the likelihood of an ICS-knowledgeable user to download and execute the malware as part of their strategy. We are continuing to monitor this situation, and we will update this advisory as we learn more. BACKGROUND Ransomware is a class of malware that aims to extort money from the victim by restricting access to resources on the computer, and then demands a monetary ransom in order to remove the restrictions. The most common type is ransomware that will encrypt important files on an infected computer, rendering the files unusable without paying a ransom. Other types may restrict access to operating system functions or specific applications. Typically the user is required to pay the ransom in some form of untraceable currency, and must do so before the deadline expires and the decryption key is destroyed.  According to the September/October 2015 issue of the ICS-CERT Monitor, ""Ransomware, such as Cryptolocker or TeslaCrypt, is currently one of the most prolific categories of malware growth, rising 165 percent in varieties seen between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015"". CUSTOMER RISK MITIGATIONS Where feasible, precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, like those listed below are recommended. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.  Obtain product software and firmware from Rockwell Automation’s official download portal, available at http://www.rockwellautomation.com/global/support/drivers-software-downloads.page. Follow industry best-practices to harden your PCs and Servers, including anti-virus/anti-malware and application whitelisting solutions. These recommendations are published in KB546987.   Consult VirusTotal.com’s analysis of the malware (using the links above), to determine if your deployed antivirus solution is able to detect this malware. (UPDATED 08-JUL-2016)   Analyze outbound network traffic against the known indicators of compromise (IoC), available from the US-CERT portal, to identify and assess the risk of any unusual network activity. Develop, and then deploy, backup and disaster recovery policies and procedures. Test backups on a regular schedule.  Implement a change management system to archive network, controller and computer assets (e.g., clients, servers and applications). Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack, which can also serve as a vehicle for malware infection. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.  Refer to http://www.rockwellautomation.com/rockwellautomation/products-technologies/network-technology/architectures.page? for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.

Version 1.2 / May 18, 2020 - Updated release product and corrected product version information. Version 1.1 / July 12, 2018 - Updated product version informtion. Version 1.0 / June 21, 2019 - Initial Release       Overview   A vulnerability exists in certain CompactLogix™ 5370 and Compact GuardLogix® 5370 programmable automation controllers that, if successfully exploited, may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. These products are used to control processes across several industries, including without limitation, critical infrastructure; water/wastewater systems; entertainment; food and beverage; and automotive applications. Due to the breadth of platforms potentially affected, Rockwell Automation® has been conducting thorough evaluations to help achieve completeness in its risk assessment and mitigation processes. Specific details of this vulnerability were disclosed publicly by researchers presenting at the ICS Cyber Security Conference in Singapore on April 25, 2018. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures, are provided herein.      Affected Products    CompactLogix 5370 L1 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015 CompactLogix 5370 L2 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015 CompactLogix 5370 L3 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015 Armor CompactLogix 5370 L3 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015 Compact GuardLogix 5370 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015 Armor Compact GuardLogix 5370 controllers, versions 30.014 and earlier, excluding version 28.015       Vulnerability Details   This vulnerability may allow threat actor to intentionally send a specific TCP packet to the product and cause a Major Non-Recoverable Fault (MNRF) resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An MNRF is a controlled action taken by the controller when it is determined that the controller could no longer continue safe operation. When a Logix controller determines that an MNRF is the right course of action, the controller is designed to fault, taking it out of run mode, logging diagnostic data, and then invalidating and deleting the controller’s memory. This action requires an application program reload to guarantee the controller has a valid program to continue safe operation. Alexey Perepechko of Applied Risk discovered this vulnerability in the 1769 Compact GuardLogix 5370 controllers. Rockwell Automation further investigated and discovered additional products affected by this vulnerability and they are included in this advisory.  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable. The impact of such an attack would be highly dependent on the nature of the attack, the design of the control system and other controls a user may have in place.  COMPACT GUARDLOGIX ADDITIONAL DETAILS If a Major Non-Recoverable Fault (MNRF) occurs in a Compact GuardLogix controller, the safety task execution stops and CIP Safety I/O modules are placed into their safe state. All other I/O modules will transition to their configured fault state (for example, Hold Last State). Memory will be marked as invalid and cleared. It is important to note that the memory clear is controlled and intentional, as the controller has determined internally that something is wrong and cannot guarantee continued safe controller execution. As a result, the controller goes into an MNRF state, which is considered safe. Recovery requires that you download the application program again.

,,N/A,PN928,,"Introduction    PowerFlex 7000 Writeable Parameters      Description   PowerFlex 7000 Writeable Parameters Version 1.0 - June 6th, 2016 This advisory is intended to raise awareness to control system owners and operators of PowerFlex 7000 medium voltage drives. A January 2016 presentation at the S4 ICS Security Conference highlighted a potential weakness in Variable Frequency Drives that allows unauthorized users to change configuration parameters in these devices. The presentation highlighted products from four vendors including Rockwell Automation. This presentation spawned several news articles, including one entitled ""An Easy Way for Hackers to Remotely Burn Industrial Motors"" from WIRED Magazine.  This article reminds us that cybersecurity threats are present and not always easy to anticipate.  Unfortunately, neither the article’s author, Kim Zetter, nor her source, Reid Wightman, have contacted Rockwell Automation at the time of writing with any specific information -- so we can only try to guess how their statements apply to our drives.  This article implies that all the drives they reference can be easily accessed and provide an easy means to change parameters, that could result in motor damage. It overlooks many self-monitoring features that are built into modern drives to prevent changes to parameters while the drive is running, detecting improper operation and monitoring external sensors for equipment, such as motors that are exceeding design parameters. Variable frequency drives, by their nature, are designed to support a wide variety of applications and it is possible that the improper setting of a parameter or parameters can create application issues.  Rockwell Automation is aware of this and constantly looks for ways to eliminate these situations or, where the possibility is created by a customer need, alert the user to the problem with a fault or error message before it causes potential damage. RISK MITIGATIONS Below are recommended mitigations and resources to help protect your deployed Rockwell Automation products, including variable frequency drives. We strongly recommend that you evaluate your current products and environment, and apply the following mitigations where applicable.  Review and employ the recommendations in the Converged Plantwide Ethernet Design and Installation Guide (DIG).  It contains important information relating to proper network design practices, including aspects of security capabilities available through the network infrastructure. Consider using Rockwell Automation’s FactoryTalk AssetCentre.  Version 6.0 offers compatibility with drives. AssetCentre can be configured to automatically backup your configuration, and compare it to a known good version, and log any changes into FactoryTalk Audit. Use trusted software, software patches, and anti-virus / anti-malware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users of the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that Internet access is carefully evaluated, protected, and controlled. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and use proper techniques to isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (""VPNs""), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

,CVE-2016-2277,Medium,Medium,,"Introduction    Integrated Architecture Builder (IAB) Access Violation      Description   Version 1.0 – February 24th 2016 A vulnerability has been discovered by Ivan Javier Sanchez of Nullcode Team in the Integrated Architecture Builder (IAB) tool. This tool is used by our customers to configure their Logix-based automation systems, select hardware, and generate bills of material for applications including controllers, I/O, networks, drives, cabling & wiring, motion control, and other devices.  The discovered vulnerability is not remotely exploitable and successful social engineering is required to convince a victim to use the tool to open an untrusted, specifically modified project file on a target computer. A successful attack may potentially allow malicious code to execute on the target computer at the same privilege level as the IAB tool. The impact to the user’s environment is highly dependent on both the type of malicious code included in this attack and the mitigations that the user may already employ. At this time there is no known publicly available exploit code.  Rockwell Automation has verified the validity of Mr. Sanchez’s discoveries and a new software release has been issued for Integrated Architecture Builder which addresses the associated risk.  Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to upgrade to this newest available software version.  Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  Integrated Architecture Builder, Versions 9.6.0.7 and earlier Integrated Architecture Builder, Versions 9.7.0.0 and 9.7.0.1  VULNERABILITY DETAILS IAB has a capability to open an existing project file containing a control system hardware definition so that the user can create a validated bill of material.  The discovered vulnerability is within the IAB.exe code that parses this project file content.  In certain cases where a uniquely crafted or altered file is used, the IAB.exe parser code execution can allow the execution of unknown code on the affected computer. If successful, such unknown code will be running at the same privilege level as the user who is logged into the machine.   Exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to convince a user to introduce or replace project files with specifically created or modified project files that have been constructed to use this condition to successfully execute malicious code.  Potential impacts from a successful attack could include a software crash (e.g. Denial of Service) thereby requiring a software restart.  In more extreme cases, the victim may not even be aware of vulnerability exploitation while an attacker has established a position on the client asset.  A successful attack that includes malicious code injection may potentially grant the attacker the same, or higher privilege-level as the victim on the affected computer, up to and including computer administrative privileges. CVE-2016-2277 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CUSTOMER RISK MITIGATIONS AND REMEDIATION Customers using affected versions of the Integrated Architecture Builder are encouraged to upgrade to the newest available software versions that address associated risk and include added improvements to further harden the software and enhance its resilience against similar malicious attacks. Where feasible, additional precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, like those listed below are similarly recommended. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.  Do not open untrusted project files with IAB.exe. Upgrade Integrated Architecture Builder V9.6.0.7 and earlier to either V9.7.0.2+ or V9.6.0.8+ (available now) using Current Program Updater.  Current Program Updater is a program that is installed on your computer when you install Integrated Architecture Builder. The User Guide to Current Program Updater is built into the application should you need additional information.Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system. Use trusted software, software patches, anti-virus/anti-malware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar Whitelisting application can help mitigate risk.

,CVE-2010-2568,N/A,PN900,,"Introduction    Rockwell Automation recommended mitigations for Zero day vulnerability (W32.Stuxnet) to Microsoft® Windows™      Description   Rockwell Automation recommended mitigations for Zero day vulnerability (W32.Stuxnet) to Microsoft® Windows™ Released: 21 July 2010 Updated: 10 August 2010 Multiple credible sources disclosed that in the days and months prior to 14 July 2010 a series of cyber events occurred that took advantage of a previously unknown Windows™ vulnerability and delivered a specially crafted payload of malware that targeted industrial control systems, SCADA/critical infrastructure processes specifically. Technical details and a patch for the Windows vulnerability used during these events have been released by Microsoft in the recently updated Microsoft Security Advisory (2286198) v2.0 dated 2 August 2010. The specific malware, commonly known as W32.Stuxnet, has been analyzed by numerous antivirus vendors and is a known threat Windows®-based systems. Rockwell Automation recommends that all industrial control system users, regardless of the make or brand of components employed within the system, take necessary steps to safeguard against potential future attacks of this type by implementing good cyber security measures as outlined below. Background A Windows™ operating system vulnerability known as the Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) was confirmed as a means to allow malware commonly known as W32.Stuxnet to load and execute on PCs. The malware has also been confirmed to specifically target Siemens WinCC and PCS-7 SCADA software products. These products are typically used to control critical infrastructure processes that include power generation, power distribution, water/wastewater and other similar applications. Rockwell Automation continues to closely monitor every aspect of this situation for new information and developments in order to provide our customers with timely and appropriate advice on this matter. Furthermore, we are continuing to work closely with appropriate authorities to review our proactive plans.  Given that industrial applications are known to heavily rely on mission-critical products built on the Windows operating system, Rockwell Automation is issuing guidance for all industrial control system customers. The following measures are intended as additions to a company’s own security policies and can help to reduce associated risk and enhance control system security. Vulnerability Description The Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability currently uses USB drives as a means of transport to infect a PC, and does not rely on user interaction or the optional AutoPlay feature employed by the Windows operating system for devices that connect to USB ports. The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 v1.1, dated 2 August 2010 details the threat and risk as follows: What causes the vulnerability? When attempting to load the icon of a shortcut, the Windows Shell does not correctly validate specific parameters of the shortcut. What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? An attacker could present a removable drive to the user with a malicious shortcut file, and an associated malicious binary. When the user opens this drive in Windows Explorer, or any other application that parses the icon of the shortcut, the malicious binary will execute code of the attacker’s choice on the target system. An attacker could also setup a malicious Web site or a remote network share and place the malicious components on this remote location. When the user browses the Web site using a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or a file manager such as Windows Explorer, Windows attempts to load the icon of the shortcut file, invoking the malicious binary. In addition, an attacker could embed an exploit in a document that supports embedded shortcuts or a hosted browser control (such as but not limited to Microsoft Office documents).  IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS  Rockwell Automation has compiled the following immediate recommendations that include advice from Microsoft, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/ICS-CERT plus added specific Rockwell Automation recommendations that can help mitigate the threat and simultaneously enhance the security of control systems: MICROSOFT recommends immediate application of a Windows software patch as referenced in Microsoft Security Advisory (2286198) and further detailed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 v1.1, dated 2 August 2010. NOTE: Rockwell Automation’s Patch Qualification team has completed an initial and partial qualification of the Microsoft Patch 2286198. See Rockwell Automation’s Immediate Recommendations below for additional information. DHS/ICS-CERT recommends concerned users immediately implement the following measures: Mitigations  Establish strict policies for the use of USB thumb drives on all enterprise and control system networks. Caution users of this attack vector and remind them that unknown USB’s should never be plugged into a business or personal computer.  Specific to this Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability and the specific W32.Stuxnet virus, malware samples were provided to the antivirus vendor community. Most major antivirus suppliers have already released updated virus definitions to contain and remove the malware.   ICS-CERT recommends consulting antivirus vendors and to consider scanning systems with current antivirus software.  NOTE: Rockwell Automation software is proactively tested for compatibility with Symantec’s Norton Antivirus software. DHS/ICS-CERT reminds users to exercise caution when using USB drives. For more information on best practices and removable media, see the ICS-CERT Control Systems Analysis Report ""USB Drives Commonly Used As An Attack Vector Against Critical Infrastructure."" www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-CERT%20CSAR-USB%20USAGE.pdf Additional DHS/US-CERT Security Tips for use of caution with USB drives can be found here: www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST08-001.html ROCKWELL AUTOMATION recommends concerned customers take the following additional precautions to enhance protection to industrial control systems: Mitigations  Apply the Microsoft Windows software patch as referenced in Microsoft Security Advisory (2286198) and further detailed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046.  NOTE: The Rockwell Automation Patch Qualification Team Partially Qualified KB2286198 on 9 August 2010, with Full Qualification on 19 August 2010.  Go to RAid:35530 for more specific information regarding the qualification of this patch. Restrict control system access to only those authorized to work with these systems. Make sure that all control system PCs are running end-point protection software (e.g. Antivirus, Anti-malware) and that all signatures are up to date. Make sure that all control system PCs follow a regimented, timely patch management process. Before applying any patch, Rockwell Automation’s recommends customers confirm that the patch has been qualified by the Rockwell Automation Patch Qualification service (www.rockwellautomation.com/security). Where practical, disable all unused USB ports on control system PCs. Consider alternatives to USB drives (e.g. network file transfer) for transferring data files to the control system Discontinue use of any USB drive or similar device if the validity, authenticity, and security of the hardware should come in question. Purchase USB drives from trusted sources. Only use USB drives manufactured by a trusted vendor Format USB drives on a non-mission critical computer that is running up to date end-point protection software (e.g. Antivirus, Anti-malware) prior to connecting the USB drive to any critical industrial control system equipment. Maintain physical security for USB drives, dongles and keys to ensure only authorized users have access and usage rights. Should a failure in physical security policy regarding USB drives be identified, perform step 9 (format USB drive on non-mission critical computer) prior to subsequent connecting to any control system equipment. Seek instructions from supplier of USB dongles and keys prior to any further use on control system equipment.  NOTE: Similar caution with optical media should be employed as with USB drives. Software delivered on CD+/-R, DVD+/-R etc. non-production optical media (e.g. user-generated, ""burned"" not ""pressed"" media) is presumed higher risk than production-grade media. As more information becomes known, Rockwell Automation expects these recommendations will be refined to help further protect control systems from the resulting risk.

,,Critical,Critical,,"Introduction    FT Historian SE OSIsoft PI Data Archive Vulnerabilities      Description   October 1st, 2015 - Version 1.0 On August 13th 2015, the Rockwell Automation Security Taskforce became aware of an advisory published by ICS-CERT (ICSA-15-225-01), which stated that OSIsoft disclosed and resolved 56 security vulnerabilities in their PI Server 2015 release. In addition to PI Server 2015, OSIsoft has also released PI Server 2012 SP1, which includes a subset of the vulnerabilities fixed in the 2015 version. OSIsoft is strongly recommending that users upgrade to the PI Server 2015 release.  FactoryTalk Historian SE includes the OSI PI Server 2012 product, including the PI Data Archive component, in the standard product image. As part of this process, Rockwell Automation has investigated the reported vulnerabilities, and has concluded that FT Historian SE customers are likely vulnerable to these same set of vulnerabilities as the PI Server product. At the time of publication, no known public exploits exist at this time for these vulnerabilities.  Details relating to these vulnerabilities, the known affected platforms and recommended mitigations are contained herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  FactoryTalk Historian SE (9518-HSEx), Versions 2.00.00, 2.10.00, 2.20.00, 3.01.00 and 4.00.00  Rockwell Automation is continuing to investigate these vulnerabilities and is actively determining future plans to address them, including incorporating the updated OSI PI Server into FactoryTalk Historian Server. This advisory will be updated when these plans are determined, as well as when updated software is available for customers to upgrade their systems. We recommend that customers apply the mitigations detailed below and subscribe to this article to receive the abovementioned notifications when updated. VULNERABILITY DETAILS According to both the ICS-CERT and OSIsoft disclosures, a portion of highest-severity vulnerabilities may allow a remote code injection by an attacker who sends a specially crafted sequence of packets to the PI Server contained in FT Historian SE.  To be successful, the attacker must have network connectivity to reach the server running FT Historian SE and be able to access port 5450 on that system. A successful exploit would allow an attacker to gain full privileges on the Windows system. With this level of access, an attacker could tamper with the system or product binaries, read and write arbitrary data, and/or tamper with user accounts on the system.  According to these disclosures, these vulnerabilities can also be used to create a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target server, rendering the FT Historian SE server unavailable to the automation system, and potentially cause either loss or corruption of the PI Server data.  RISK MITIGATIONS  Limit access to PI Server Port 5450, which reduces exposure to the highest-rated vulnerabilities. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

,,N/A,PN391,,"Introduction          Description   Potential Security Vulnerabilities Rockwell Automation has identified three potential security vulnerabilities related to the web interface of the 1756-ENBT/A EtherNet/IP Bridge Module (the ""Product""). Specifically, the risks include the following:  The potential for cross-site scripting, which could allow the Product to be used in a social engineering attack.  An attacker could potentially craft a URL that looked as if it would take a user to the Product, but would instead execute script from a different location. A successful attack would require the attacker to transmit the crafted URL to a user with access to the web interface of the Product and to convince that user to open the URL.  The potential for web redirection, which could allow the Product to be used in a social engineering attack.  An attacker could potentially craft a URL that looked as if it would take a user to the Product, but would actually direct the browser to a different location. A successful attack would require the attacker to transmit the crafted URL to a user with access to the web interface of the Product and to convince that user to open the URL.  The potential for exposure of some of the Product’s internal web page information. While this does not directly present a functional vulnerability, it does expose some internal information about the module.  Risk Mitigation None of these issues results in the Product’s web pages or other Product functions being compromised or otherwise affected.

,,N/A,PN359,,"Introduction    Firmware Upgrade Security Notice: Comment on DHS Communication (Control Systems Vulnerability in Multiple Sectors)      Description   Rockwell Automation recognizes the importance of information and control system security to our customers.  We are committed to working with government agencies and standards development organizations to develop solutions targeted to help our customers improve their overall system security strategy. As part of this effort, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Control Systems Security Program, under contract to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), identified a potential security concern within the firmware upgrade process used in control systems deployed in Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR).  DHS has confirmed that the firmware upgrade process can be intentionally manipulated in a manner that has potential to render the device inoperable and cause a disruption to the process and/or system operation. Rockwell Automation has been working in partnership with DHS to identify potential short-term and long-term mitigation strategies.  As a result, Rockwell Automation is implementing a policy to digitally sign most firmware images and require contemporary devices to validate this signature before applying a firmware upgrade.  Over time, many contemporary Rockwell Automation products will include this signature validation mechanism to help ensure firmware integrity and authenticity. The following Rockwell Automation products currently authenticate firmware using digital signatures:  ControlLogix 1756-L72, L73, L74, L75 Programmable Automation Controllers Virtual firmware of the 1789 SoftLogix PC based controllers  For other devices, to help reduce the likelihood of the upgrade process being exploited and help reduce associated security risk, Rockwell Automation and DHS recommend the following short-term mitigation strategies (Note: multiple strategies can be employed simultaneously):  Disable where possible the capability to perform remote firmware upgrades over a network to a controller by placing the controller key switch into RUN mode.  This prevents the Allen‑Bradley brand controllers from accepting firmware upgrades.  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation networks and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment and perform product firmware upgrades to that equipment.  Restrict firmware upgrades to the local ControlNetwork or direct (point-to-point) physical methods only by physically or electronically isolating target devices from any larger system while performing a firmware upgrade.  Temporarily remove unnecessary network connections to the device before administering a firmware upgrade.  Reactivate device-specific security measures and replace network connections only after a successful firmware upgrade.  Block all traffic to the EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by restricting or blocking access to TCP and UDP Port# 2222 and Port# 44818 using appropriate security technology (e.g. a firewall, UTM devices, or other security appliance).  Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and ControlNetworks.  Rockwell Automation is currently investigating additional long-term mitigation strategies that include, but are not limited to:  Additional techniques to verify the authenticity of firmware updates to help reduce the likelihood of file tampering.  Enhancements to the joint Rockwell Automation / Cisco Plantwide Reference Architecture that detail methods and recommendations which can further strengthen control system security.

A successful exploitation of one of these potential vulnerabilities could result in a Denial of Service (""DoS"") condition to the web portal of the affected device. A successful exploitation of the second vulnerability could potentially result in a DoS to the controller where it enters a major non-recoverable fault (""MNRF""). A MNRF is considered a safe state. Further details about MNRFs can be found in the vulnerability details section. Customers using the affected products are strongly encouraged to evaluate the mitigations provided below and apply the appropriate mitigations to their deployed products. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended security guidelines, are provided herein. At the time of this writing, the Rockwell Automation® Product Security Incident Response Team (""PSIRT"") is unaware of any active exploitation of these potential vulnerabilities.      Affected Products    CompactLogix 5370 L1 controllers, versions 20 to 30 and earlier CompactLogix 5370 L2 controllers, versions 20 to 30 and earlier CompactLogix 5370 L3 controllers, versions 20 to 30 and earlier Compact GuardLogix® 5370 controllers, versions 20 to 30 and earlier Armor™ Compact GuardLogix 5370 controllers, versions 20 to 30 and earlier       Vulnerability Details   About Major Non-Recoverable Faults (""MNRFs"") If a MNRF occurs in a CompactLogix controller, all I/O modules will transition to their configured fault state (for example Hold Last State). Memory will be marked as invalid and cleared. It is important to note that the memory clear is controlled and intentional, as the controller has determined internally that something is wrong and cannot guarantee continued safe controller execution. As a result, the controller goes into a Major Non-Recoverable Faulted state, which is considered safe. Recovery requires that you download the application program again. Vulnerability #1: Email Object Stack Overflow Denial of Service Rockwell Automation received a report describing a vulnerability where a remote, unauthenticated threat actor could send crafted SMTP configuration packets to port 44818 potentially causing a Denial of Service condition, where the controller enters a major non-recoverable faulted state (""MNRF""). CVE-2019-10954 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Rockwell Automation evaluated the vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (""CVSS"") v3.0. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6/10 has been assigned. For a better understanding of how this score was generated, please follow this link with the CVSS v3 vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Vulnerability #2: Web Portal Denial of Service Younes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the web server of CompactLogix 5370 PLCs. By sending specific requests to the web server, a remote, unauthenticated threat actor could potentially force the web server to become unreachable, potentially preventing the user from gaining web access to view live controller data. A reset of the device is required to recover the web server. The control functions of the product are not affected by this vulnerability. CVE-2019-10952 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

,,N/A,PN715,Date; 20-SEP-2018; 18-JUL-2012,"Introduction    Advisory on web search tools that identify ICS devices and systems connected to the Internet      Description   Version 1.1 - September 20, 2018 SUMMARY This Industrial Security Advisory is intended to raise the awareness to control system owners and operators of increased risks that stem from publicly-available web search tools that identify Internet-connected devices. These types of tools and search utilities can be used for legitimate research purposes; however, they also bear a potential for misuse by threat actors seeking to gather added intelligence about prospective cyber targets. Rockwell Automation recognizes the potential risk to any device connected in a network that is accessible by unauthorized people, whether the device is isolated within a protected facility or if it is accessible through a remote connection, including the Internet. We are aware that such Internet search tools have the ability to identify Rockwell Automation branded products that are connected, either intentionally or unintentionally by the device owners to the Internet. For this reason, recommendations to mitigate associated risks are provided herein. BACKGROUND Web-based tools, including SHODAN and the Every Routable IP Project (ERIPP) provide a means for users to discover information about networked devices that are either knowingly or unknowingly connected to the Internet. Such connected products include, but are not limited to: web servers, routers, webcams, smart phones, VoIP phones, printers and in some cases industrial control products. The information collected by these search tools about these Internet-facing devices includes device IP addresses and can also include geographic location (i.e. country, city and approximate latitude/longitude), specific product identity information or user-added descriptors that can be learned through device fingerprinting techniques. Some of these tools also provide a means to both search and filter databases for devices that match specific user-defined search criteria. POTENTIAL RISK to INDUSTRIAL CONTROL DEVICES and SYSTEMS Many devices cataloged by these search tools have been designed and installed with the full knowledge they are directly connected to the Internet; however, other devices identified by these tools were not intended by the manufacturer, or potentially the device installer to ever carry a direct connection. As with all networked device and systems, industrial control systems are at risk of both accidental and potentially malicious attacks. The availability of search tools that simplify the process of locating and identifying devices unintentionally connected to the Internet raises associated risk to these devices and systems. It is evident based on the device information that some of these devices and accompanying systems lack recommended security protections facilitated by good security design and infrastructure-level appliances (e.g. firewalls, SIEMs, and intrusion detection systems). As a consequence, these types of devices and systems may not operate with obscurity and may become exposed to additional unintended risks. Information provided through search tools could aid a curious individual or malicious threat actor in device-tampering activities or even a penetration into the product or connected system in order to facilitate a cyberattack. RISK MITIGATIONS and RECOMMENDED USER ACTIONS Whether or not Internet-facing industrial control devices are identified by these tools, Rockwell Automation encourages all industrial control system (ICS) owners and operators to follow good security design practices. https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en_NA/capabilities/industrial-networks/technical-data/overview.page? These practices must also include careful evaluation and monitoring of all industrial control system connection points to an enterprise system and external remote access connections enabled via modems or direct connections to the Internet. We recommend concerned customers remain vigilant and continue to follow sound security strategies that help reduce risk and enhance overall control system security. Where possible, we suggest customers apply some of the following recommendations and complement this list with their own best-practices:  Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and ControlNetworks. Refer to http://www.rockwellautomation.com/global/products-technologies/network-technology/architectures.page for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures. If appropriate for the application, isolate the Industrial Control System network from the Enterprise network and other points of potential remote network access. Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment. Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked. Use up to date end-point protection software (e.g. antivirus/anti-malware software) on all PC-based assets. Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases. Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices. Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode. Enlist additional security expertise by engaging Rockwell Automation’s Network & Security Services team for specialized, consultative services.

FactoryTalk Alarms and Events is used to provide a common, consistent view of alarms and events through a FactoryTalk View SE HMI system and is used across several sectors, including without limitation: critical infrastructure; water/wastewater systems; entertainment; food and beverage; and automotive applications. Customers using affected versions of this product are encouraged to evaluate the mitigations provided below, and apply the applicable mitigations to their deployed products. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures, are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS FactoryTalk Alarms and Events v2.90 and earlier. Factory Talk Alarms & Events is a component of the FactoryTalk Services platform. Customers using FTAE-based alarms in FactoryTalk View SE or Logix-based alarms in ControlLogix / CompactLogix processors will be impacted. FactoryTalk Alarms & Events is installed by several products:  FactoryTalk Services (RSLinx® Enterprise), all versions FactoryTalk View SE, version 5.00 and later Studio 5000 Logix Designer®, version 24 and later  Affected customers may consult the Risk Mitigation section of this advisory for information on how to address the issue. VULNERABILITY DETAILS An unauthenticated attacker with remote access to a network with FactoryTalk Alarms and Events can send a specially crafted set of packets to port TCP/403 (the history archiver service), causing the service to either stall or terminate. The history archiver service of FactoryTalk Alarms and Events is used to archive alarms and events to a Microsoft SQL Server database. Disrupting this capability can result in a loss of information, the criticality of which depends on the type of environment that the product is used in. The service must be restarted in order to restore operation. CVE-2017-14022 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Rockwell Automation evaluated the vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (""CVSS"") v3.0. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5/10 has been assigned. For a better understanding of how this score was generated, please follow this link with the CVSS v3 vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H RISK MITIGATIONS and RECOMMENDED USER ACTIONS Customers using the affected software are encouraged to update to an available revision that addresses the associated risk. Customers who are unable to update are directed towards risk mitigation strategies provided below, and are encouraged, when possible, to combine these with the general security guidelines to employ multiple strategies simultaneously.       Product Family  Version In Use  Suggested Actions    Factory Talk Alarms and Events  V2.90   - Implement the V2.90 patch (instructions)  - Disable TCP port 403.  See item #2 below for details.     Factory Talk Alarms and Events  V2.81 and earlier   - Update to FTAE V2.90 from PCDC (instructions) then implement the V2.90 patch (instructions)  - Disable TCP port 403.  See item #2 below for details.      FactoryTalk Alarm and Event history is logged using the Rockwell Alarm Historian service using port 403, and writes alarms and events to the user-configured SQL Server database. If the Rockwell Automation Alarm Historian service is on the same machine as the Rockwell Alarm Event service, then port 403 can be blocked remotely as the historical information is being logged to the local host rather than a remote host. Any other machine in the system that does not have the Rockwell Alarm Historian service on the same machine as the Rockwell Alarm Event service will require access to port 403.  Note: FactoryTalk View SE clients using the Alarm and Event Log Viewer to view FactoryTalk Alarm and Event history do not require port 403 and can thus be blocked.  GENERAL SECURITY GUIDELINES  Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP™ or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port# 2222 and Port# 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, Unified Threat Management (UTM) devices, or other security appliances.

Rockwell Automation, along with Cisco Systems, Inc. (""Cisco""), have determined that all versions of the Allen‑Bradley® Stratix® 5100 Wireless Access Point/Workgroup Bridge (""Stratix 5100 WAP/WGB"") are affected by one of these ten vulnerabilities when the device has been configured with a specific non-default configuration. This vulnerability can be exploited by a Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK), in which a malicious actor tricks the victim into reinstalling a key that is already in-use. A successful attack may allow the attacker to operate as a ""man-in-the-middle"" between the device and the wireless network. This could then be leveraged to manipulate the data stream, remove TLS/SSL and/or grab credentials and confidential information in transmission. The Stratix 5100 wireless access point provides an 802.11 compliant Wi-Fi implementation that wirelessly connects client devices to an Ethernet based network. The vulnerabilities are solely exploitable in close proximity to a device that is actively joining to a previously joined wireless network. Customers using this device are encouraged to evaluate the mitigations provided below, and apply the applicable mitigations to their deployed products. Additional details relating to the vulnerability are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS Stratix 5100 Wireless Access Point/ Workgroup Bridge Version 15.3(3)JC1 and earlier  This includes the following catalogs:  1783-WAPAK9 1783-WAPBK9 1783-WAPCK9 1783-WAPEK9 1783-WAPNK9 1783-WAPTK9 1783-WAPZK9  VULNERABILITY DETAILS Key Reinstallation Attacks (""KRACK"") work against the four-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol. KRACK takes advantage of the retransmission of a handshake message to prompt the installation of the same encryption key every time it receives message 3 from the Access Point (""AP""). Retransmission of the handshake message from the AP occurs if a proper client acknowledgement is not received to the initial message; retransmission resets the nonce value and replay counter to their initial values. A malicious actor could force these nonce resets by replaying the appropriate handshake message, which could allow for injection and decryption of arbitrary packets, hijacking of TCP connections, injection of HTTP content, or replaying of unicast or multicast data frames on the targeted device. CVE-2017-13082 has been assigned to this vulnerability. Rockwell Automation evaluated the vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (""CVSS"") v3.0. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.9/10 has been assigned. For a better understanding of how this score was generated, please follow this link with the CVSS v3 vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N The original public security advisory issued by Cisco is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171016-wpa The report by US-CERT is available at the following link: https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/228519 RISK MITIGATIONS and RECOMMENDED USER ACTIONS Rockwell Automation recommends that all customers patch the clients that connect to the Stratix 5100 WAP/WGB, and recommends contacting your vendor to get the most updated patch that is compatible with your client devices. However, patching the client only protects the connection formed by that specific client. In order to protect all future clients that may be added to your system, Rockwell Automation recommends patching the Stratix 5100 WAP/WGB when the firmware is available. UPDATE: NOVEMBER 6, 2017 After further investigation, Rockwell Automation has determined that since the vulnerability affects Stratix 5100 access points with 802.11r enabled, and 802.11r is not fully supported on the Stratix 5100 WAP/WGB, that access-point users are not affected by this vulnerability, and patching the Stratix 5100 WAP/WGB is not required when the device is operating as an access point. To verify that 802.11r is disabled in your device, please refer to this Knowledgebase Article ID 1068007. It is still suggested that users refer to manufacturers of their connected wireless client devices for suggested patch procedures. Alternatively, a workaround exists for CVE-2017-13082.  If you are using a Stratix 5100 in Access Point (""AP"") mode (and not in Workgroup Bridge mode (""WGB"") and you have enabled 802.11r fast roaming, it is recommended that the 802.11r fast roaming function should be disabled.  In order to disable 802.11r, do one of the following:  Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) and issue the following commands with administrative privileges:      Command   Purpose     configure terminal   Enters Global Configuration Mode     interface Dot11Radio0   Enters Radio0 (2.4GHz) Configuration     no dot11 dot11r   Executes command to disable 802.11r     Interface Dot11Radio1   Enters Radio1 (5GHz) Configuration     no dot11 dot11r   Executes command to disable 802.11r     end   Exits to privileged EXEC mode     write   Writes configuration to Non-volatile memory        In the web interface, Navigate to the ""Network"" tab, select ""Network Interface"", then ""Radio0-802.11n 2G.hz"", ""Settings"", and verify the disable radio button next to ""11r Configuration"" is selected. Repeat these steps with ""Radio0-802.11n 5G.hz""  NOTE: Disabling 802.11r could have a negative impact on the performance and availability of a customer’s system. Customers are encouraged to evaluate the impact to specific environments before performing this workaround GENERAL SECURITY GUIDELINES  Use trusted software, software patches, anti-virus/anti-malware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP™ protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port# 2222 and Port# 44818 using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, Unified Threat Management (""UTM"") devices, or other security appliances.

Cisco Talos, Cisco’s threat intelligence organization, has created two Snort rules (SIDs): 41909 and 41910 to detect exploits utilizing this vulnerability, which can be used on Stratix 5950 Security Appliances positioned appropriately within your network architecture to provide enhanced visibility. The Snort rules (SIDs) are enabled following curated rule sets - ""Balanced Security and Connectivity"", ""Connectivity over Security, and ""Secure over connectivity.  GENERAL SECURITY GUIDELINES  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls. As an extension to this approach, the Allen‑Bradley® Stratix 5950 Industrial Network Security Appliance, which comprises Intrusion Prevention and Detection (IDS/IPS) services, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP), Rockwell Automation can now offer customers an intrusion detection system to provide visibility, in real-time, if a vulnerability is being exploited. The Stratix 5950 contains a rules engine called FirePOWER which can process rules created by Cisco TALOS for a variety of known security issues. Once configured with rules, the FirePOWER engine inspects the contents of every packet, looking for datapoints that correspond to one or more rules. Packets that have these signatures can be either logged (IDS) or blocked (IPS).

A well-defined service path enables Windows to easily find the path to a service; this is accomplished by containing the path within quotation marks. Without quotation marks, any whitespace in the file path remains ambiguous, and an attacker could drop a malicious executable if the service path is discovered. This vulnerability allows an authorized individual with access to a file system to possibly escalate privileges by inserting arbitrary code into the unquoted service path. When the Windows Service Manager starts the service, it will attempt to launch the implanted executable rather than the intended and authentic executable. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS v3 vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H RISK MITIGATIONS Where feasible, precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, like those listed below, are recommended.

NotPetya is a Petya-inspired malware variant and behaves in a manner similar to how the “WannaCry” malware that surfaced in May 2017 did, specifically in that it is a self-propagating ""worm"" that infects any vulnerable host that has not patched the Windows SMBv1 vulnerability. Microsoft patched this vulnerability, named “MS17-010,” in March 2017. However, it is worth noting that this malware has some key differences from WannaCry, including how it propagates to other machines and how it attacks the victim’s PC. As of this writing, there is no known direct impact to Rockwell Automation products from this malware, though all files present on a machine (including files used by Rockwell Automation products) may be encrypted in the event of a successful attack. However, customers who use Rockwell Automation software products may be vulnerable to this attack since most of the Rockwell Automation software products run on Microsoft Windows platforms containing the underlying vulnerability which enables this attack. Rockwell Automation decided to provide this advisory since customers running Rockwell Automation software on Microsoft Windows may be vulnerable to this attack. Information and links to Microsoft-provided resources are provided below, as well as our qualification report for MS17-010. We are continuing to monitor this situation, and we will update this advisory as we learn more.      Affected Products   According to Microsoft’s MS17-010 Security Bulletin, the following operating systems contain the vulnerability:  Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 R1/R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2016  Note: Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are vulnerable.  Note: At the time of this writing, and according to Microsoft, no versions of Windows CE are affected.      Vulnerability Details   This malware is similar in many ways to the WannaCry malware that surfaced in May 2017, but it also includes different methods for the encryption of files and propagation across the network to infect new machines. Reports suggest that if the Petya malware has administrative privileges, it does not encrypt files individually through a whitelist approach, but instead will encrypt the entire filesystem, rendering the machine completely in-accessible. Industrial control system (“ICS”) specific files, which may not have been specifically included in past whitelists, will now also be encrypted along with any other file on the filesystem. The initial Petya infection comes from opening an infected file, attached to an email. Once a machine on a victim’s network is infected, Petya utilizes multiple mechanisms to propagate through the victim’s network without any type of user interaction, such as is common with the following social engineering-based attacks: -     EternalBlue, the same SMB exploit which allowed WannaCry to propagate. -     Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), using the user’s credentials. -     Microsoft PSexec tool, using the user’s credentials.      Risk Mitigation & User Action   The risk from EternalBlue can be mitigated by applying updates from MS17-010. The other two attack vectors can be mitigated through blocking ports utilized by those protocols. Rockwell Automation strongly recommends that customers review the Microsoft MS17-010 Security Bulletin, evaluate the potential risks, and implement a mitigation plan. Microsoft has provided patches for ALL affected operating systems, including XP and 2003. Rockwell Automation suggests that before implementing any Microsoft updates, the updates should be verified on a non-production system, or when the facility is non-active, to help ensure that there are no unexpected results or side effects. The Rockwell Automation Microsoft Patch Qualification team has qualified versions of our products on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with MS17-010 installed. For detailed information on versions tested, visit the Rockwell Automation Microsoft Patch Qualification site: https://www.rockwellautomation.com/ms-patch-qualification/start.htm.

,,N/A,PN1492,,"Revision History       Revision History   Version 1.1 - May 18, 2017       Introduction   On May 10, 2017, a new ransomware attack called ""WannaCry"" (also known as ""WannaCrypt""), began affecting Microsoft Windows personal computers (""PCs"") around the world. The ransomware is a self-propagating ""worm"" that infects any vulnerable host that has not patched the SMBv1 Windows vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched in March 2017 by Microsoft and has been named ""MS17-010"", which is included in the monthly Microsoft roll-ups: ""MS17-006"". Unlike previous ransomware variants that require social engineering (""phishing""), WannaCry takes advantage of a publicly known vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, which allows it to spread quickly throughout a network and infect additional hosts with no user interaction. As of this writing, there is no known direct impact to Rockwell Automation products from this ransomware. However, customers who use Rockwell Automation software products may be vulnerable to this attack since this software runs on Microsoft Windows platforms containing the underlying vulnerability which enables this attack. Ransomware is a class of malware that aims to extort money from the victim by restricting access to resources on the computer, and then demands a monetary payment in order to remove the restrictions. The most common type is ransomware that will encrypt important files on an infected computer, rendering the files unusable without paying a ransom. Other types may restrict access to operating system functions or specific applications. Typically, the user must pay a ransom (in some form of untraceable currency), and must do so before the deadline expires and the decryption key is destroyed. Rockwell Automation decided to provide this advisory since customers running Rockwell Automation software on Microsoft Windows are likely vulnerable to this attack. Information and links to Microsoft-provided resources are provided below, as well as our qualification report for MS17-010. We are continuing to monitor this situation, and we will update this advisory as we learn more.      Affected Products   According to Microsoft's MS17-010 Security Bulletin, the following operating systems contain the vulnerability:  Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 R1/R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2016   Note: Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are vulnerable. At the time of this writing, and according to Microsoft, no versions of Windows CE are affected by these vulnerabilities.""      Vulnerability Details   According to Microsoft's MS17-010 Security Bulletin: This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends specially crafted messages to a Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS  26-APR-2017 Update: Stratix 8300 Version 15.2(4)EA and earlier Stratix 5400, Stratix 5410, Stratix 5700, Stratix 8000, ArmorStratix 5700 Version 15.2(4)EA3 and earlier  Updates for all affected products are now available, and linked in the table provided. Stratix product firmware versions not listed above are not affected by these vulnerabilities. VULNERABILITY DETAILS Vulnerability #1: AAA Authentication Fail Denial of Service A vulnerability in the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) service for remote Secure Shell Host (SSH) connections to the device could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the vulnerable device to reload. This vulnerability is a result of an error log message that is shown when a remote SSH connection to the device fails AAA authentication. Upon failure, the remote SSH attacker receives the previously configured banner which can be used to authenticate the targeted device. A successful attack could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Cisco’s product security disclosure for their Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-aaados A Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (""CVE"") ID has been assigned to this vulnerability: CVE-2016-6393 has been assigned to this vulnerability.  A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned to this vulnerability; the CVSS v3 vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Vulnerabilities #2 and #3: Software Multicast Routing Denial of Service Vulnerabilities Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the multicast subsystem of Cisco’s IOS and IOS XE Software, allowing for unauthenticated, remote attackers to create a DoS condition. The first vulnerability is in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MDSP) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient checking of MSDP Source-Active (SA) messages received from a configured MSDP peer. If an attacker can send traffic to the Internet Protocol version 4 (""IPv4"") address of an affected device, a maliciously-crafted packet would trigger the issue. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to restart. The second vulnerability is due to insufficient checking of packets encapsulated in a Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) register message. An attacker who is able to send Internet Protocol version 6 (""IPv6"") register packets can create a malformed packet to send to a PIM rendezvous point in order to exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to restart. Cisco’s product security disclosure for their Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-msdp CVE-2016-6382 has been assigned to this vulnerability.  A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned to this vulnerability; the CVSS v3 vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Vulnerability #4: DNS Forwarder Denial of Service and Information Corruption A vulnerability exists in the Domain Name System (""DNS"") forwarder functionality in the software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to restart or corrupt the information existing in the device’s local DNS cache, or read part of the process memory. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling crafted DNS response messages. An attacker could utilize this vulnerability by intercepting and crafting a DNS response message to a client DNS query that was forwarded from the affected device to a DNS server. A successful attack could cause the device to reload, which is a DoS, or corrupt the information on the local DNS cache. Cisco’s product security disclosure for their Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-dns CVE-2016-6380 has been assigned to this vulnerability.  A CVSS v3 base score of 9.9 has been assigned to this vulnerability; the CVSS v3 vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H. Vulnerability #5: Software Smart Install Memory Leak Denial of Service A vulnerability in the Smart Install client feature could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak and an eventual DoS condition on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of image list parameters. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send crafted Smart Install packets to Transmission Control Protocol (""TCP"") port 4786. A successful attack could cause the switch to leak memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco’s product security disclosure for their Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-smi CVE-2016-6385 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Where possible these can be applied alongside the upgrade in software version (above) to further mitigate risk of exposure.    Vulnerability Workaround (if available) Other Notes   #1: AAA Authentication DoS The AAA Failed-Login Banner can be removed via the command no aaa authentication fail-message. AAA Failed-Login Banner needs to be configured and SSH used for a remote connection to the device in order to exploit the vulnerability. To check if AAA is configured, use the show running-config  include aaa command to check the AAA configuration and verify that it returns output.   #2 and #3: Multicast Routing DoS There are no workarounds for either vulnerability N/A   #4: DNS Forwarder DoS and Info Corruption There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. N/A   #5: Software Smart Install Memory Leak There are no workarounds other than disabling the Smart Install feature. This can be done on some versions of firmware with the ""no vstack"" global configuration command. To determine whether a device is configured with the Smart Install client feature, use the command show vstack config. If the output is Role: Client, then this confirms that the feature is enabled on the device.     Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that SNMP requests from unauthorized sources are blocked. Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/anti-malware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack. Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

Help minimize any unnecessary network exposure by assessing all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that firmware is kept up to date 2.     Use proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls. As an extension to this approach, the Allen‑Bradley® Stratix 5950 Industrial Network Security Appliance offers an Intrusion Prevention System and an Intrusion Detection (IDS/IPS) System, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). With the introduction of this new product, Rockwell Automation can offer customers an intrusion detection system to provide real-time visibility in the event that a vulnerability is being exploited. The Stratix 5950 Security Appliance uses Cisco FirePOWER™ technology, which allows created rules to be processed by Cisco TALOS for a variety of known security issues. Once configured with rules, the FirePOWER engine inspects the contents of every packet, looking for datapoints that correspond to one or more rules. Packets that have these signatures can be either logged using IDS or blocked using IPS. For further information on Rockwell Automation’s Vulnerability Handling process, please refer to our FAQs document. For additional information on deploying the Stratix 5950, please see our Deploying Industrial Firewalls within a CPwE Architecture Guide.

,,High,High,,"Revision History       Revision Number    1.0      Revision History    Version 1.0 - February 16, 2017.  Initial Release.       Revision History       Revision Number    2.0      Revision History    Version 2.0 - April 09.2020.  Corrected mitigation versions from v9.01 to V12.       Introduction    Connected Components Workbench™ Software Dynamic Link Library (""DLL"") Hijack      Executive Summary   Rockwell Automation received a report from independent researcher Ivan Javier Sanchez about a vulnerability in the Connected Components Workbench™ (""CCW"") software. CCW is a design and configuration software that helps simplify standalone machine development by offering a single environment for controller programming, device configuration and visualization. DLL hijacking is a known and documented vulnerability that affects software running on Microsoft® Windows operating systems. The effects of this attack can range from a denial-of-service (""DoS""), to the injection of malicious code into trusted processes, depending on the content of the DLL and the risk mitigations in place by the victim. As of this announcement, there is no known publicly available exploit code relating to this vulnerability. Version 2.0 Update: Rockwell Automation received a vulnerability report from Reid Wightman, a researcher from Dragos, reporting that additional versions of CCW continued to be affected by this vulnerability. Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to evaluate the mitigations provided below and apply the applicable mitigations to their deployed products. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures, are provided herein.      Affected Products    Connected Components Workbench - Developer Edition, v11.00.00 and earlier Connected Components Workbench - Free Standard Edition, v11.00.00 and earlier       Vulnerability Details   Certain DLLs included with versions of CCW software can be potentially hijacked to allow an attacker to gain rights to a victim’s affected personal computer (PC). Such access rights can be at the same, or potentially higher, level of privileges as the compromised user account, including and up to computer administrative privileges. DLL hijacking requires user interaction and thus cannot be exploited remotely. The exploits are triggered only when a local user runs the vulnerable application, which then loads the untrusted DLL file in place of the real DLL file. Exploiting this vulnerability relies on successful social engineering of a victim to run at an application with the untrusted file, or to access a malicious webpage that is susceptible to browser redirection. These actions could allow an untrusted binary or DLL to be loaded into the memory of a client computer in place of the intended DLL. The impacts of a successful DLL hijacking attack can range from a software crash (i.e. Denial-of-Service), which would require a restart, to the injection of malicious code into trusted processes. The impact of an attack that injects malicious code is highly dependent on both the type of code included in the attack, as well as any mitigations than the user may already employ. If the software is running as a high-privileged user, any injected code will also execute with those high privileges. The malicious code can also access process memory space that stores sensitive information or additional services that may be manipulated by the modified DLL. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.0 has been assigned; the CVSS v3 vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H      Risk Mitigation & User Action   Customers using versions of affected software are encouraged to take the following actions:  Apply Connected Components Workbench – Developer Edition v12.00.00 (Download) or Connected Components Workbench – Free Standard Edition v12.00.00 (Download). Apply the risk mitigations and recommended user actions in Knowledgebase Document ID PN1498 / Article ID 1125780. Apply the risk mitigations and recommended user actions in Knowledgebase Document ID PN1499 / Article ID 1125782.       General Security Guidelines    Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system. Use of Microsoft AppLocker or another whitelisting application can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation® products is available at Knowledgebase Article ID 546989. Ensure that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.

,CVE-2016-5814,High,High,Product Family; RSLogix Micro; RSLogix Micro; RSLogix 500; RSLogix 500,"Introduction    RSLogix 500® and RSLogix™ Micro File Parser Buffer Overflow      Description   Version 1.1 - FEBRUARY 14 - 2017   UPDATE: Feb 14, 2017  Rockwell Automation has released a new version of software, v11.00.00, which contains the remediation for this vulnerability. Affected customers are encouraged to update to the most recent release to take advantage of the latest security patches. In June 2016, Rockwell Automation was notified by ICS-CERT of a buffer overflow vulnerability that exists in its RSLogix™ Micro Starter Lite product, a free starter programming software used to program logic for the Allen‑Bradley MicroLogix™ product family.  This vulnerability is not remotely executable, and successful social engineering is required to convince a victim of using the tool to open an untrusted, specifically modified project file on a target computer. A successful attack may potentially allow malicious code to execute on the target computer at the same privilege level as the logged-in user. The impact to the user’s environment is highly dependent on both the type of malicious code included in this attack and the mitigations that the user may already employ. Currently, there is no publicly available exploit code relating to this vulnerability.  Rockwell Automation has evaluated the report and confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in RSLogix™ Micro Starter Lite. We further investigated and confirmed this vulnerability in the additional versions of RSLogix 500® and RSLogix™ Micro. We have released updated software to address the associated risk. Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to upgrade to this newest available software version.  Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  RSLogix™ Micro Starter Lite, Versions 10.00.00 and earlier  RSLogix™ Micro Developer, Versions 10.00.00 and earlier  RSLogix 500® Starter Edition, Versions 10.00.00 and earlier  RSLogix 500® Standard Edition, Versions 10.00.00 and earlier  RSLogix 500® Professional Edition, Versions 10.00.00 and earlier  A patch for v8.40.00 is available now and is only for v8.40.00, links are provided below. The remediation will also be available in the next major revision of the software. This advisory will be updated when additional versions are available. VULNERABILITY DETAILS The discovered vulnerability exists in the code that opens and parses the RSLogix 500 and RSLogix Micro project files, identified by the RSS extension. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited in RSLogix 500 and RSLogix Micro, an attacker must create a malicious RSS file, which is the native file format for this software package. If the malicious project file is opened by an affected version of the product, the buffer overflow condition is exploited. Likewise, if the attack is successful, the unknown code will run at the same privilege level as the user who is logged into the machine.  Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the attacker to successfully convince a user to open a modified project file on their machine.  Potential impacts from a successful attack could include a software crash (for example, Denial of Service) which then requires a software restart. However, in more extreme cases, the victim may not even be aware of vulnerability exploitation while an attacker has established a position on the client asset.  A successful attack that includes malicious code injection may potentially grant the attacker the same or higher privilege-level as the victim on the affected computer, up to and including computer administrative privileges. CVE-2016-5814 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned; the CVSS v3 vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). RISK MITIGATIONS The following precautionary measures are recommended as additional risk mitigation strategies for this type of attack. If possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.  Do not open untrusted .RSS files with RSLogix 500 and RSLogix Micro.  Customers using affected versions of RSLogix 500 and RSLogix Micro are encouraged to apply the patch that address associated risk and include added improvements to further harden the software and enhance its resilience against similar malicious attacks.

,"CVE-2016-4522,, CVE-2016-4531",High,High,Product Family; FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix,"Introduction            Description   Version 1.0 - June 21, 2016 Rockwell Automation has internally discovered and remediated two authentication-based vulnerabilities in the Rockwell Software FactoryTalk® EnergyMetrix™ product. FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix is a web-enabled management software package that gives you access to critical energy information, and allows you to capture, analyze, store, and share energy data with key stakeholders using a standard web browser. The first vulnerability concerns user credentials that are not immediately invalidated after an explicit logout action is performed by the user, which may allow an attacker to use these credentials in perpetuity. The second vulnerability is an SQL Injection vulnerability which may allow an attacker to access the FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix system without valid user credentials. Both vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. At this time, there is no known publicly available exploit code relating to the vulnerabilities. Rockwell Automation has examined associated vectors and revised product software has been released to address risks. Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix v2.10.00 and earlier   VULNERABILITY DETAILS Authenticated User Token Remains Valid after Logout When a user explicitly logs out of their FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix account, their authentication token is not immediately invalidated by the system. An attacker who obtained this token would be able to access the FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix system at the same privilege level as the user, by resending the captured token with their request. CVE-2016-4531 has been assigned to this vulnerability.  A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).

,,N/A,PN886,,"Introduction    MicroLogix Web Redirect Vulnerability      Description   September 17, 2015 - Version 1.0 On August 11, 2015, the Rockwell Automation Security Taskforce was notified by ICS-CERT of a vulnerability discovered by a security researcher in the Allen‑Bradley MicroLogix 1400 product family. The researcher previously disclosed this information at the DEFCON 23 conference on August 8, 2015. The researcher publicly disclosed details relating to this vulnerability, including the existence of exploit code. However, at the time of publication, no known exploit code relating to this vulnerability has been released to the public. ICS-CERT published an alert (ICS-ALERT-15-225-02A) to cover this vulnerability. As part of this process, Rockwell Automation expanded the scope of its evaluation beyond the MicroLogix platform in order to determine if this same threat-vector has the potential to affect other Rockwell Automation product platforms. Rockwell Automation has also reproduced the vulnerability in the MicroLogix 1400, and further discovered and reproduced the vulnerability in the MicroLogix 1100 product family. Due to the breadth of platforms potentially affected, Rockwell Automation has been conducting thorough evaluations to ensure completeness in its risk assessment and mitigation process. Details relating to this vulnerability, the known affected platforms and recommended countermeasures are contained herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  1766-L32BWA, 1766-L32AWA, 1766-L32BXB, 1766-L32BWAA, 1766-L32AWAA, 1766-L32BXBA, Version 15.002 and earlier. 1763-L16AWA, 1763-L16BWA, 1763-L16BBB, 1763-L16DWD, Version 14.000 and earlier.  Rockwell Automation will resolve this vulnerability in the next minor revision of product firmware, currently expected to be available in the October 2015 timeframe. This advisory will be updated to provide upgrade information when it is available. VULNERABILITY DETAILS The vulnerability in the MicroLogix’s webserver allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web content into an unsuspecting user’s web browser by using a built-in feature to ""redirect"" outside web content into the product’s web pages. This outside web content could contain malicious content that would target the web browser when the content is rendered. The impact to the user’s automation system would be highly dependent on both the type of web exploits included in this attack and the mitigations that the user may already employ. The target of this type of attack is not the MicroLogix itself. Instead, the MicroLogix is used as a vehicle to deliver an attack to a device running a web browser.  A successful attack would not compromise the integrity of the device or allow access to confidential information contained on it. On rare occasions the availability of the device may be affected if used in a large-scale phishing campaign. Vulnerable devices would effectively be a trusted host, used to unknowingly deliver potentially malicious content because of this vulnerability. RISK MITIGATIONS  Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments. Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.

,,Medium,Medium,Software Name; RSView32; Software; RSView32,"Introduction    RSView32 Weak Encryption Algorithm on Passwords      Description   April 30, 2015 - Version 1.0 A vulnerability has been discovered by Vladimir Dashchenko and Dmitry Dementjev, Information Security Analysts at Ural Security System Center (USSC), in the encryption approach used by specific versions of RSView32 software to protect the contents of a file containing user-defined passwords.  The passwords stored within the file are used to authenticate users in order to grant access to the software and user-created content.  Rockwell Automation has verified the validity of Mr. Dashchenko and Dementjev’s discovery and a software patch has been release for RSView32 that enhances the security of the mechanism used to create, manage and make-use of user-defined passwords by the software.  Customers who continue to use affected versions of the software are encouraged at a minimum to apply this patch, or migrate to more contemporary Rockwell Automation solutions.  Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following software has been confirmed to be susceptible to the reported vulnerability:     Software Name  Version    RSView32 All software versions up to and including RSView32 - 7.60.00 (CPR9 SR4)     VULNERABILITY DETAILS, RISK and POTENTIAL IMPACTS A vulnerability has been discovered in the encryption approach used by RSView32 to create a password storage file used with the software.  User-defined usernames and passwords for RSView32 are stored within the users.act file.  The associated weakness in the file is a result of the software using a weak and outdated encryption algorithm.  The technology weakened password complexity prior to encrypting the password.  In addition, the algorithm’s strength has decreased over time as compared to more contemporary encryption technologies.  Content encrypted with this older algorithm, such as the users.act file, may be susceptible to unauthorized decryption.  If successfully exploited, user-defined passwords can be learned.  For such exposure, an attacker must first gain access to the specific password storage file, or to a copy of the file that is stored local to the RSView32 product.  In order to gain such access, the security of the local machine would need to be compromised in some way to allow local or remote access, or some form of successful social-engineering would be needed to convince a victim to grant access to, or supply the particular file to a malicious third party.  To make use of the passwords to access user-defined RSView32 protected content, an attacker would similarly need to reverse-engineer the decryption algorithm to learn the plain text, before being able to authenticate and gain access to that protected content.  At this time there is no known publicly available exploit code. CUSTOMER RISK MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION A software patch has been released for RSView32 to mitigate risk associated with the discovered vulnerability.  Customers using affected versions of the RSView32 are encouraged to apply this patch and take added precautions as outlined herein. Where feasible, additional precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, like those listed below are similarly recommended.  When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.  Apply the following patch if using an affected software version:       Software   Catalog Number   Affected Software       Recommendation     RSView32   9301-2SEx    All software versions prior to, not includingRSView32 - 7.60.00 (CPR9 SR4)  >>>   Apply reference software patch:  RSView32 - 7.60.6.11  https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com /app/answers/detail/a_id/635640      Limit access to assets with RSView32 and other software only to authorized personnel. Restrict network access to assets with RSView32 and other software as appropriate. Use trusted software and software patches that are obtained only from highly reputable sources. Interact with, and only obtain software and software patches from trustworthy websites. Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar Whitelisting application can help mitigate risk.  Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/546989. Follow good network design practices that include network separation and segmentation, use of DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems. Maintain layered physical and logical security, defense in depth design practices for the ICS. Reaffirm with employees the importance for constant vigilance, especially the ongoing potential for social engineering attacks to manipulate otherwise normal user behaviors. Upgrade the affected product to a more contemporary, in-support product and compatible operating system; Establish a patch management and product upgrade strategy too*    *ONGOING RISKS AND PRODUCT MIGRATION The RSView32 product has inherent technical limitations that are likely to make subsequent security patches more difficult, if not altogether infeasible in the future.  Furthermore, RSView32 is not compatible with certain contemporary versions of the Microsoft Windows® operating system.  While this particular product patch helps to mitigate a very specific security risk, it has no positive effect on other known and unknown vulnerabilities in the Windows OS on which the product is installed and operates.  In addition, some Windows versions (with which the product still operates) are no longer in support by the manufacturer, yet they are known to be highly susceptible to a variety of significant, unpatchable security risks.  We recommend customers consider upgrading their software and compatible operating systems to more contemporary versions everywhere possible.  In parallel, customers should adopt measures to keep products current and patched.  For those customers who choose to continue using RSView32, we strongly recommend they upgrade the operating system on which the product runs to a compatible version that is as current as possible and is still in support by the manufacturer.  When this compatibility can no longer be assured, or the operating system support expires, Rockwell Automation stands ready to help our customers migrate to contemporary solutions as we also help protect and leverage their previous investments.

The discovered vulnerability is not remotely exploitable and successful social engineering is required to convince a victim to use the test client to open an untrusted, specifically modified CSV file on a target computer.  A successful attack may potentially allow malicious code to execute on the target computer at the same privilege level as OpcTest.exe.  At this time there is no known publicly available exploit code.  Rockwell Automation has verified the validity of Mr. Sanchez’ discoveries and a new software release has been issued for RSLinx Classic that includes a new version of OPCTest.exe to address the associated risk.  Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to upgrade to this newest available software version.  Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following software has been confirmed to be susceptible to the reported vulnerability:     Software Name  Version    RSLinx Classic  All versions prior to, not including 3.73.00      VULNERABILITY DETAILS, RISK and POTENTIAL IMPACTS OpcTest.exe has a capability to import a comma-separated values (CSV) file, containing lists of tags and groups, so that the software user can easily subscribe to these items from the RSLinx Classic software.  The discovered vulnerability is within the OpcTest.exe code that parses this CSV content.  In certain cases where a uniquely crafted or altered file is used, the OpcTest.exe parser code execution can encounter a buffer overflow, which has potential to modify the stack and allow the execution of unknown code on the affected computer.  If successful, such unknown code will be running at the same privilege level as the user who is logged into the machine.   Exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to convince a user to introduce or replace CSV files with specifically created or modified CSV files that have been constructed to use this buffer overflow condition to successfully execute malicious code.  Potential impacts from a successful attack could include a software crash (e.g. Denial of Service) thereby requiring a software restart.  In more extreme cases, the victim may not even be aware of vulnerability exploitation while an attacker has established a position on the client asset.  A successful attack that includes malicious code injection may potentially grant the attacker the same, or higher privilege-level as the victim on the affected computer, up to and including computer administrative privileges. CUSTOMER RISK MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION Customers using affected versions of the RSLinx Classic are encouraged to upgrade to the newest available software versions that address associated risk and include added improvements to further harden the software and enhance its resilience against similar malicious attacks.  Where feasible, additional precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, like those listed below are similarly recommended.  When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.

,,Medium,Medium,Software Name; FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP); FactoryTalk View Studio; Software; FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP); FactoryTalk View Studio,"Introduction    FactoryTalk Services Platform and FactoryTalk View Studio DLL Hijacking Vulnerability      Description   February 12, 2015 - version 1.0 A vulnerability has been discovered by independent researcher Ivan Javier Sanchez in software components that comprise and are shared by the FactoryTalk Services Platform used in FactoryTalk-branded product and FactoryTalk View Studio. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely without user interaction. The exploits are only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, and it loads the malformed DLL file.  Exploiting this vulnerability relies on successful social engineering of a victim to run an untrusted file or to access a malicious webpage using a browser susceptible to redirection. These actions could allow an untrusted binary or DLL to be loaded into the memory of a client computer. At this time there is no known publicly available exploit code.  Rockwell Automation has verified the validity of Mr. Sanchez’ discoveries and released new FactoryTalk Services Platform and FactoryTalk View Studio software to address associated risk.  Customers using affected versions of this software are encouraged to upgrade to the newest available software versions or apply appropriate patches as indicated below.  Additional details relating to the discovered vulnerability, including affected products and recommended countermeasures are provided herein. AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following software has been confirmed to be susceptible to the reported vulnerability:     Software Name Version  Verify Software Version Method   FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP) All versions prior to and not including 2.71 Software version can be verified using Windows Add/Remove programs utility   FactoryTalk View Studio Version 8.00.00 and all prior versions Software HelpAbout      VULNERABILITY DETAILS, RISK and POTENTIAL IMPACTS It was discovered that certain DLLs (Dynamic Link Library) that are included with older versions of FactoryTalk Services Platform and View Studio software can be potentially hijacked to allow an attacker to gain access rights to a victim’s affected PC.  Such access rights can be at the same, or potentially higher level of privileges as the compromised user account, including up to computer administrative privileges. DLL hijacking is a known and documented vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows operating systems.  Exploitation of this vulnerability typically requires social engineering to successfully introduce a malicious DLL onto a target computer and within a specific file directory set as the default DLL search path for the particular edition of Microsoft Windows operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would either have to breach account access or get someone to install software or a specific DLL that was not approved.  The malicious DLL would need to be installed onto the target computer in a specific file directory set as the default DLL search path for the particular edition of Microsoft Windows operating system. When a DLL vulnerability is exploited, trusted software can unknowingly load an untrusted DLL in place of the intended DLL.  Its effects can range from a software crash (i.e. Denial of Service) requiring software restart, to more significant events such as the injection of malicious code into trusted processes.  The malicious code can also access process memory space that may store sensitive information or additional services that may be manipulated by the modified DLL. CUSTOMER RISK MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION Although there are no known exploits at this time, customers using affected versions of the FactoryTalk Services Platform and View Studio are encouraged to upgrade to the newest available software versions where possible, or to apply appropriate patches.  Upgrade affected products as follows:     Software   Catalog Number   Affected Firmware    Recommendation    FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP) N/A All software versions prior to and not including 2.71.00 >>>   Upgrade to V2.71.00 or higher (available now) If an upgrade is not currently possible, apply Patch V2.70.00: KB#631115 Note: This software is included with Studio 5000™ software Version 24 and higher.

,,High,High,Software; Connected Component Workbench (CCW) Software; Current CCW software can be obtained here: http://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?crumb=112 Product Search: CCW Version: 7.00.00 (or higher),"Introduction    Connected Components Workbench (CCW) ActiveX Component Vulnerability      Description   Original Release: October 14, 2014 - Version 1.0 November 3, 2014 - Version 1.1 (UPDATE-A) <<< START UPDATE-A >>> A vulnerability has been reported affecting two custom ActiveX components provided with the Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software. If exploited, it will crash a targeted component and it can potentially allow for arbitrary code injection on the computer hosting the component. The vulnerability is both locally and remotely exploitable via a successful social engineering attack, such as an attack that targets a victim or victims via a phishing campaign. At this time there is no known publicly available exploit code. <<< END UPDATE-A >>> Rockwell Automation has verified the validity of the vulnerability claim and released a new software build, Version 7.00.00 to address associated risk. In parallel, other CCW software components in this new build have been bolstered as a result of the company’s focus on security-quality and continuous improvement. All customers using CCW software prior to Version 7.00.00 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to Version 7.00.00 or newer at their earliest convenience. Refer to the following for additional details relating to the vulnerability, affected product and recommended countermeasures. AFFECTED PRODUCTS  All software versions prior to and including Version 6.01.00 of Connected Component Workbench (CCW) Software Note: CCW Version 7.00.00 and higher are not susceptible to the reported vulnerability.   EXPOSURE  All computers with Connected Component Workbench (CCW) Software Version 6.01.00 and earlier. Note: CCW Version 7.00.00 and higher are not susceptible to the reported vulnerability.   <<< START UPDATE-A >>> VULNERABILITY DETAILS The reported CCW ActiveX vulnerability is the result of a software coding error that was further compounded by the use of an older version of a compiler used to create the custom ActiveX components. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send an arbitrary, out of range value to a particular property of an affected ActiveX component to crash its operation and then potentially allow for an execution of unauthorized code on the computer hosting the software. Neither the CCW software, nor the vulnerable ActiveX components necessarily need to be running for an attack to be successful. The attack vector to exploit this vulnerability first requires a user with local access to the computer containing both a susceptible ActiveX component and a container to either knowingly or unknowingly execute some form of malicious code. Such code could likely be delivered via the loading of an infected webpage or some document opened in a web browser or other container capable of running ActiveX controls. A plausible attack scenario could begin with a phishing attack, whereby a victim is convinced to open and run a malicious HTML file or other such infected file, or to visit a maliciously-altered webpage that has been tailored to specifically exploit this vulnerability in an affected ActiveX component. <<< END UPDATE-A >>> Potential impacts from a successful attack could include a simple crash of CCW software (e.g. Denial of Service), thereby requiring a software restart to recover from the crash. In more extreme cases, the victim may not even be aware of vulnerability exploitation since neither CCW nor an affected ActiveX component needs to be running for an attacker to inject malicious code to the susceptible software component. A successful attack that includes malicious code injection may potentially grant the attacker the same, or higher privilege-level as the victim on the affected computer, up to and including computer administrative privileges. RISK MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION A new version of CCW software, Version 7.00.00 has been released to address associated risk with the vulnerability in the affected ActiveX components. This same software release also includes added software improvements to enhance product security and resilience against similar malicious attacks. All customers using CCW software are encouraged to upgrade to Version 7.00.00 or newer at their earliest convenience. The following immediate mitigation strategies are recommended. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.

,,High,High,Controller Platform; MicroLogix 1400; Current firmware for the MicroLogix 1400 Series B platform can be obtained here:  http://www.rockwellautomation.com/rockwellautomation/support/pcdc.page,"Introduction    MicroLogix 1400 DNP3 Denial of Service Vulnerability      Description   September 9, 2014 - Version 1.0  Rockwell Automation was notified by independent researcher Matthew Luallen of CYBATI (https://cybati.org/) and ICS-CERT of a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability to the DNP3 implementation of the Allen‑Bradley MicroLogix 1400 controller platform.  At this time, there is no known publicly available exploit code relating to the vulnerability.  Rockwell Automation has verified Mr. Luallen’s discovery and released revised product firmware to address associated risk.  Refer to the following for additional details relating to the vulnerability, affected product and recommended countermeasures.  AFFECTED PRODUCTS In collaboration with Mr. Luallen, Rockwell Automation has determined certain Allen‑Bradley MicroLogix 1400 controller platforms are affected by this vulnerability:  1766-Lxxxxx Series A FRN 7 or earlier; 1766-Lxxxxx Series B FRN 15.000 or earlier  Note:  DNP3 communication is disabled by default in the product.   VULNERABILITY DETAILS DNP3 communication is disabled by default in the MicroLogix 1400 product.  If the DNP3 capability is enabled, specific versions of the product become susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that can be triggered when the product receives a particular series of malformed packets over its Ethernet or local serial ports that are directed at the link layer DNP3 header.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a disruption of the DNP3 application layer process and a loss of product communication and availability on the network, thereby resulting in a denial of service condition.  Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered remotely and the attack is repeatable.  Furthermore, the DoS results will be successful regardless of controller’s mode switch setting.  Product recovery from the denial of service condition requires a power cycle, yet the product will remain susceptible to subsequent attacks until the vulnerability is addressed or the threat is adequately mitigated or removed.  RISK MITIGATIONS A new version of MicroLogix 1400 Series B firmware has been released to address the vulnerability and reduce associated risk to successful exploitation.  Subsequent versions of MicroLogix 1400 Series B firmware and newer will incorporate these same enhancements.   The following immediate mitigation strategies are recommended.  When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously.  1.

,,Medium,Medium,,"Introduction    FactoryTalk Activation Manager Unnecessary Third-party Service      Description   November 8, 2013 - version 1.0 During the installation of FactoryTalk Activation Manager, a software service from SafeNet Technologies called the Sentinel Local License Manager is automatically installed along with drivers for the USB activation dongles sometimes used with FactoryTalk Activation. These USB dongles are manufactured by SafeNet Technologies.  The Sentinel Local License Manager service is configured to start automatically on the Windows host.  Furthermore, the service listens on three (3) communication ports: 1947/TCP, 1947/UDP, and an additional variable UDP port.  Recent evaluation of FactoryTalk Activation manager has determined the Sentinel Local License Manager service is unnecessary when SafeNet USB activation dongles are used with FactoryTalk Activation.  The service is also unnecessary or for the operation of any Rockwell Automation products.  Additionally, security testing has identified the Sentinel Local License Manager service may fail when the specific communication ports it listens on become overwhelmed, or when specifically crafted traffic is directed at these ports and the accompanying service.  The failure of the Sentinel service is trapped in software.  No indications have been observed for potential code injection or successful escalation of privilege on the host.  To date, we are not aware of any known cases of successful exploitation of this vulnerability in FactoryTalk Activation Manager.  Furthermore, we are not aware of publicly available proof of concept exploit code.  AFFECTED PRODUCTS  FactoryTalk Activation Manager v3.30 and greater on all Microsoft Windows operating systems is affected.  RISK MITIGATION Rockwell Automation recommends disabling the SafeNet Sentinel Local License Manager service (hasplms.exe) unless specifically required by a non-Rockwell Automation application.  Instructions for performing this operation are found in Knowledge Base (AID:570831).  In addition, when a host-based firewall is available, we recommend blocking communication ports 1947/TCP and 1947/UDP on the host computer.

,,N/A,PN744,Product; MicroLogix 1100 controller; MicroLogix 1200 controller; MicroLogix 1400 controller; MicroLogix 1500 controller,"Introduction    MicroLogix, SLC 500 and PLC5 Controller Vulnerability      Description   Released: October 26, 2012 Updated: August 2, 2013 <Update A> On September 14, 2012, the Rockwell Automation Security Taskforce was notified by ICS-CERT of a vulnerability discovered by a security researcher in the Allen‑Bradley MicroLogix 1400 controller platform. Details relating to this vulnerability, including the existence of exploit code, have been made public by the researcher at various training events. At this time, no known exploit code relating to this vulnerability has been released to the public.  On October 2, 2012 Rockwell Automation independently initiated and maintained direct contact with the researcher to obtain pertinent facts relating to this matter due to lack of sufficient details shared through ICS-CERT. We continue to work with the researcher directly and keep him apprised of the expanded scope of impact from his initial findings.  As a matter of course, Rockwell Automation expanded scope of this evaluation beyond the MicroLogix 1400 platform in order to determine if this same threat-vector has potential to impact other A-B controller platforms. Rockwell Automation has reproduced the vulnerability. Due to the breadth of platforms potentially affected, we have been conducting thorough evaluations to ensure completeness in our risk assessment and mitigation process.  Details relating to this vulnerability, the known affected platforms and recommended countermeasures are contained herein.  AFFECTED PLATFORMS Rockwell Automation has determined the following A-B products are affected by this vulnerability:  MicroLogix 1100 controller MicroLogix 1200 controller (all versions prior to 13.000) MicroLogix 1400 controller MicroLogix 1500 controller (all versions prior to 13.000) SLC 500 controller platform PLC5 controller platform  VULNERABILITY DETAILS MicroLogix Controller Platform The vulnerability in the MicroLogix controller platform occurs due to inadequate write protection measures on the controller’s Status file.  The MicroLogix controller is susceptible to a remotely exploitable Denial of Service (DoS) attack should it receive certain messages that change specific status bits in the controller’s Status file. Under these specific conditions, an attack will be successful regardless of controller’s mode switch setting. A successful attack will cause the controller to cease its logic execution and enter a fault state. Recovery from this fault state requires the controller’s operating mode selector to be switched via direct physical interaction.  SLC 500 Controller Platform The vulnerability in the SLC 500 controller platform occurs when the controller’s Status file property is not set to ""Static,"" thereby allowing changes to the file contents.  When the SLC 500’s Status file is not configured to ""Static,"" the SLC 500 controller is susceptible to a remotely exploitable Denial of Service (DoS) attack when it receives certain messages that change specific bits in its Status file. Under these specific conditions, an attack will be successful regardless of controller’s mode switch setting. A successful attack will cause the controller to cease its logic execution and enter a fault state. Recovery from this fault state requires the controller’s operating mode selector to be switched via direct physical interaction.  PLC5 Controller Platform The vulnerability in the PLC5 controller platform occurs when the controller’s ""Password and Privileges"" feature is disabled.  When the Passwords and Privileges feature of the PLC5 controller is not enabled, the PLC5 controller is susceptible to a remotely exploitable Denial of Service (DoS) attack when it receives certain messages that change specific bits in its Status file. Under these specific conditions, an attack will be successful regardless of controller’s mode switch setting. A successful attack will cause the controller to cease its logic execution and enter a fault state. Recovery from this fault state requires the controller’s operating mode selector to be switched via direct physical interaction. RISK MITIGATIONS MicroLogix Controller Platform <Begin Update A>     Product   Recommended Action     MicroLogix 1100 controller   Upgrade product firmware to release 13.000 or greater  http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/plc/micrologix/downloads.html     MicroLogix 1200 controller   Upgrade product firmware to release 13.000 or greater  http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/plc/micrologix/downloads.html      MicroLogix 1400 controller   Upgrade product firmware to release 14.000 or greater  http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/plc/micrologix/downloads.html     MicroLogix 1500 controller   Upgrade product firmware to release 13.000 or greater  http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/plc/micrologix/downloads.html     <End Update A> In addition to the above product-level mitigations, Rockwell Automation recommends the following mitigation strategies to help reduce the likelihood of compromise and the associated security risk. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously:  1. Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and ControlNetworks. Refer to http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures. 2. Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.  3. Block all traffic to the EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by restricting or blocking access to TCP and UDP Port# 2222 and Port# 44818 using appropriate security technology (e.g. a firewall, UTM devices, or other security appliance). 4. Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment. 5. Enlist additional security expertise by engaging Rockwell Automation’s Network & Security Services team for specialized, consultative services. For more detail visit http://www.rockwellautomation.com/services/security/  We will communicate additional mitigation strategies to our concerned customers should more direct product-level mitigations be developed that can further reduce associated risk from this vulnerability.  SLC 500 Controller Platform Remote attempts to write data to the SLC 500 platform’s Status file are ignored and discarded by setting the controller’s Status file properties to ""Static"" via RSLogix 500 software.  Rockwell Automation recommends where possible that the Status file ""Static"" configuration setting be enabled to reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation of the vulnerability. The ""Static"" file property setting is configured in the Status File Properties page of RSLogix 500 software.  PLC5 Controller Platform Remote attempts to write data to the PLC5 platform’s Status file are ignored and discarded by using the controller’s ""Password and Privileges"" feature, configured via RSLogix 5 software.

These vulnerabilities have been confirmed to be remotely exploitable which can lead to termination of affected software services and Denial of Service conditions.  To date, Rockwell Automation is not aware of any known cases of successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities in operational systems.  Furthermore, we are not aware of publicly available proof of concept exploit code.  Rockwell Automation worked directly with Mr. Eiram to verify his findings, determine root cause and validate the resulting software patches being issued for the FactoryTalk Services Platform and RSLinx Enterprise software.  Given the company’s focus on continuous improvement, added steps are being taken to further enhance the development and testing processes associated with these products.  As a result, additional product hardening enhancements have been included in the referenced software patches and will continue to be deployed via forthcoming product releases.  AFFECTED PRODUCTS  All FactoryTalk-branded software,  including CPR9-SR0 through SR6 All RSLinx Enterprise software, prior to and including CPR9 and CPR9-SR1 through SR6  VULNERABILITY DETAILS AND IMPACTS  FACTORYTALK SERVICES PLATFORM (RNADiagnostics.dll)  The software components exhibit a vulnerability as a result of missing input validation and improper exception handling with streaming data.  A specially crafted packet sent to TCP port 5241 will result in a crash of the RsvcHost.exe service.  A successful attack will result in the following:  Denial of Service (DoS) condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections on UDP port 4445. Crash condition that disrupts further execution of the RNADiagnostics.dll  or RNADiagReceiver.exe diagnostic service.  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely from a network-based attack; however, no possibility of malicious code injection or escalation of privilege on the host machine is known to result from successful exploitation.  There is also no indication that exploitation will directly disrupt operation of a Rockwell Automation programmable controller, operator interface or other networked device connected elsewhere in the local control system.  RSLINX ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE (LogReceiver.exe and Logger.dll)  These software components exhibit a vulnerability as a result of a logic error in the service’s handling of incoming requests on UDP port 4444 (user-configurable, but not enabled by default) of zero or large byte datagrams.  When successfully exploited, the vulnerability will cause the thread receiving data to exit, resulting in the service silently ignoring further incoming requests.  A successful attack will result in two respective conditions:  Denial of Service (DoS) condition that prevents subsequent processing of connections on UDP port 4444. Crash condition that disrupts further execution of the LogReceiver.exe  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely with the potential for code injection; however, no possibility of escalation of privilege on the host machine is known to result from successful exploitation.  Although theoretical, a possibility of remote code execution has been identified.  There is also no indication that exploitation will directly disrupt operation of a Rockwell Automation programmable controller, operator interface or other networked device connected elsewhere in the local control system. < Update Start> As a result of additional analysis conducted by Risk Based Security, Inc. of the LogReceiver.exe service, additional enhancements have been made to the LogReceiver.exe to further increase resiliency of the service. < Update End >   RISK MITIGATION  Software patches for affected FactoryTalk Services Platform and RSLogix Enterprise software are being released to mitigate associated risk:      Product Description   Affected Versions   Recommendations     FactoryTalk Services Platform (FTSP)   CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4,   Upgrade to FTSP CPR9-SR5 or newer     CPR9-SR5   Apply patch: AID#522048 https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/522048     CPR9-SR5.1   Apply patch: AID#522049 https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/522049     CPR9-SR6   Apply patch: AID#522052 https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/522052         Product Description   Affected Versions   Recommendations     RSLinx Enterprise   CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4,   Upgrade to RSLinx CPR9-SR5 or newer     CPR9-SR5   Apply patch: AID# 544798 https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/544798 Update: AID# 534705 has been replaced with AID: 544798 which includes additional security enhancements.

,,N/A,PN758,,"Introduction    Stratix 5700, 8000 and 8300 Weak Password Vulnerability      Description   April 2, 2013 - version 1.0  Rockwell Automation has become aware of a weak password protection implementation affecting Allen‑Bradley brand Stratix™ managed Ethernet switch firmware.  This weakness affects Stratix 5700, 8000 and 8300 managed switches products that contain particular versions of IOS® firmware that employ a Type 4 (SHA256) cryptographic password hash algorithm.  Due to an implementation issue in affected IOS versions, a user-provided password that has been hashed using the IOS Type 4 algorithm implementation is less resilient to brute-force attacks than a Type 5 hashed password of equivalent complexity.  Successful exploitation of this weakness can lead to unauthorized access to the product.  To date, we are not aware of any known cases of successful exploitation of this vulnerability in Stratix 5700, 8000 or 8300 products.  Furthermore, we are not aware of publicly available proof of concept exploit code.  AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Stratix managed Ethernet switches are affected:  Stratix 5700 firmware release 15.0(1)EY1.  This firmware ships on all Stratix 5700 catalog items. Stratix 8000 firmware release 15.0(2)SEIES.  This firmware is known as release 7 and was released in January 2013.  This firmware does not, and has never shipped on the Stratix 8000.  It would reside on a Stratix 8000 only after the product’s initial shipment and only if intentionally downloaded to the hardware. Stratix 8300 firmware release 15.0(2)SEIES.  This firmware is known as release 7 and was released in January 2013.  This firmware does not, and has never shipped on the Stratix 8300.  It would reside on a Stratix 8300 only after the product’s initial shipment and only if intentionally downloaded to the hardware.  To determine if a Stratix 8000 or Stratix 8300 is using the above firmware, you can reference the software field located on the dashboard of Device Manager or the IOS Release field on the switch status tab located in the RSLogix 5000 Stratix Add on Profile.  RISK MITIGATION For details and recommended action to mitigate this security vulnerability in products that contain the affected IOS, go to the following Cisco web site.  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityResponse/cisco-sr-20130318-type4   In addition to the above, we recommend concerned customers remain vigilant and continue to follow security strategies that help reduce risk and enhance overall control system security.  Where possible, we suggest you apply multiple recommendations and complement this list with your own best-practices:  Where feasible, use a unique and complex password for products so as to help reduce the risk that multiple products could be compromised as a result of a single password becoming learned. Where feasible, adopt password management practices to periodically change product passwords to help mitigate risk for passwords to remain usable for an extended period of time. Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and control networks. Refer to http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures. Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment and perform product firmware upgrades to that equipment. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.

,,N/A,PN753,,"Introduction    Vulnerability claims relating to FactoryTalk Services and RSLogix 5000 Software      Description   November 29, 2012 - version 1.0 On November 25, 2012, Exodus Intelligence, Inc. (Exodus) disclosed a limited amount of information relating to purported vulnerabilities in some Rockwell Automation products. In addition, they identified associated risks relating to third-party software that is included with the Rockwell Automation product installation. As a result of this information disclosure, Rockwell Automation’s Security Taskforce independently reached out to Exodus to request greater details to help us validate these claims and assess risk so we could rapidly establish a responsible risk mitigation strategy for our customers. On November 28, 2012, Exodus provided greater details of their findings directly to Rockwell Automation. This included specific information about affected products, product versions and also proof-of-concept exploitation code that demonstrates the particular product weaknesses. With our receipt of this information, Rockwell Automation launched a detailed technical evaluation of the claims and we further expanded our preparations to support our customers in risk remediation activities, if such actions should become necessary. As a result of Rockwell Automation’s technical evaluations, the vulnerability claims made by Exodus have been validated and verified to affect an older version of a component of the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk services platform. The particular affected component had been previously identified and has since evolved to already remove any risk associated with Exodus’ findings. Rockwell Automation’s Security Taskforce evaluations specifically determined:    One vulnerability identified by Exodus was a re-discovery of a previous known anomaly in a component version of a software service. Rockwell Automation addressed this vulnerability via software patch first issued on October 4, 2011. In addition to releasing the patch, specific process improvement steps were put in place to remove risk of re-introducing the anomaly in subsequent product releases.    A second vulnerability identified by Exodus had already been internally identified and isolated by Rockwell Automation as a result of our ongoing code review processes within our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). This vulnerability was similarly addressed in the same above product patch issued on October 4, 2011. Similar process improvement steps were put in place at that time to avoid potential to carry the anomaly forward in newer software releases.  For specifics relating to the publicized vulnerabilities and resulting patch, refer to: https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/456144     Exodus’ observation is accurate that Rockwell Automation software installations sometimes include third-party content such as Adobe® Reader. Such software is often included as a convenience for customers who may lack immediate access to the Internet to obtain a PDF viewer necessary to read certain electronic documentation included with our products.  In July 2008, at the time of the particular Rockwell Automation RSLogix 5000 product release evaluated by Exodus, Adobe® Reader Version 8 was a current version of PDF reader software. Since our initial product release, our subsequent software releases and master installation files have undergone numerous incremental and major revisions. These incremental product releases lead to the ongoing creation of newer software master installs which, where possible include more-current third-party content such as Adobe Reader. A customer who acquires today the particular 2008 release of RSLogix 5000 software from Rockwell Automation receives a software installation that includes more contemporary versions of third-party content, e.g. Adobe Reader X (Version 10).  We continue to encourage all customers to be proactive and stay current where possible with software patches and new product releases for all software used in their control systems.   CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND MATURITY MODEL Rockwell Automation shares in the same concerns as our customers, product users, security research community and the public at large with regard to the industrial control system security.   We continue to make significant investment in our product development and testing processes and also provide relevant product and system security features to our customers to help protect assets, information and operational integrity.   Our internal Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) continues to mature and demonstrate tangible value to help proactively address potential product and system design weaknesses.   We parallel our product security developments, testing and overall SDL investments with added lessons learned from our formal approach to product security Threat Management and Incident Response.   These combined efforts and others result in a maturity model allowing for continuous improvements in our contemporary solution that successfully enhance product and system security. Where technically feasible, some of these same improvements are also made available for many legacy products and systems too. ADDED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RISK MITIGATION Rockwell Automation advocates that all industrial control system asset owners invest to assess security risks in their automation systems and take appropriate measures to reduce known risks to an acceptable level. A balance of both technical and non-technical measures comprises a successful Security Program, therefore risk-reducing compensating controls should include a combination of careful product selection, network and infrastructure design and installation, maintenance and upgrade planning and consistent personnel training complemented by structured policies and procedures for employees to follow. In particular, keeping software and hardware products and system components up to date remains a key imperative to help maintain and enhance the security posture of industrial control systems.

The public disclosure of these findings occurred at the S4 conference and included details to allow for potential reproduction and exploitation of these vulnerabilities. <Update A> Rockwell Automation released firmware for the MicroLogix 1400 controller in June 2012 to address the identified product vulnerability in a potential replay attack directed at the product’s webserver. Due to technical limitations in the MicroLogix 1100 platform, to reduce associated risk with this vulnerability Rockwell Automation recommends concerned customers follow good industrial control system design and security practices including those listed below in RISK MITIGATION.   AFFECTED PRODUCTS Rockwell Automation’s Security Taskforce has determined the following Rockwell Automation products are affected by this vulnerability   MicroLogix 1100   MicroLogix 1400     VULNERABILITY DETAILS The webserver password authentication mechanism employed by the affected products is vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and Replay attack. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will allow unauthorized access of the product’s webserver to view and alter product configuration and diagnostics information. Recovery from successful exploitation of this vulnerability may require the product to be reset to its factory-default settings.   RISK MITIGATION Enhancements to the MicroLogix 1400 firmware are being released that reduce the potential for a successful replay attack targeting the product’s webserver.   MicroLogix 1400     Catalog Number   Description   Affected Products   Corrective Firmware     1766-L32xxxx   MicroLogix 1400 controller   Series B FRN 11 or earlier   FRN 12 or higher     Current firmware for MicroLogix can be obtained here: http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/plc/micrologix/downloads.html       <Update A>   MicroLogix 1100 and 1400 To help reduce the likelihood of compromise and the associated security risk, Rockwell Automation recommends the following immediate mitigation strategies. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously: 1. Where possible for affected products, disable the web server in the Ethernet Channel 1 configuration in RSLogix 500 software. This is done by unchecking the HTTP Server Enable checkbox (checked by default) and power cycling the controller. 2. Change all default Administrator and Guest passwords. 3. If webserver functionality is desired in the MicroLogix 1100 or 1400 controllers, we recommend the product’s firmware be upgraded to the most current version that includes enhanced protections including: a. When a controller receives two consecutive invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, the controller resets the Authentication Counter after 60 minutes. b. When a controller receives 10 invalid authentication requests from any HTTP client, it will not accept any valid or invalid Authentication packets until a 24-hour HTTP Server Lock Timer timeout.  WARNING/REMINDER: Upgrading the controller firmware clears the web server configuration. It is necessary to manually record the web server settings prior to a firmware upgrade so the configuration can be manually re-entered into the web server settings after the firmware upgrade is complete.  NOTE: The latest MicroLogix 1100 and 1400 firmware versions are posted at: http://www.ab.com/linked/programmablecontrol/PLC/MicroLogix/downloads.html  4. If webserver functionality is desired in the MicroLogix 1100 or 1400 controllers, we recommend you configure User Accounts to only provide READ access to the product (e.g. do not configure READ/WRITE for Users). In addition, where possible exclusively access the product via User Accounts to minimize potential for a Replay attack to the Administrator’s account. User-administration is done through the product’s webserver. NOTE: Rockwell Automation continues to investigate and evaluate other product-level strategies to address this vulnerability. In addition to the above, we recommend concerned customers remain vigilant and continue to follow security strategies that help reduce risk and enhance overall control system security.

,,Medium,Medium,,"Introduction    RSLogix 5000 .ACD Project File Memory Corruption Anomaly      Description   July 26, 2011 - version 1.0 An anomaly affecting specific versions of RSLogix 5000 software has been brought to Rockwell Automation’s attention by independent researchers and ICS-CERT. The identified anomaly relates to how RSLogix 5000 software, versions 19 and earlier, processes its native format .ACD project files. Details of this anomaly are as follows:  The potential exists for affected versions of RSLogix 5000 software to accept a maliciously altered ACD project file that can result in an integer overflow condition, which can in turn cause the RSLogix 5000 software to terminate unexpectedly. In addition, the possibility for the injection of malicious software during this condition has not been definitively ruled out. This anomaly affects all RSLogix 5000 releases up to and including Version 19.  There are no known exploits involving this anomaly. Successful exploitation would require social engineering to introduce and convince a user to open a maliciously altered ACD file. Additionally, there is no known proof-of-concept code or means to demonstrate results any more serious than the unexpected termination of the RSLogix 5000 application. Rockwell Automation’s technical evaluation and testing confirm the presence of this anomaly, but similarly indicates successful exploitation as a security vulnerability remains only theoretically possible. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that no escalation of privilege can result from successful exploitation of this anomaly. Mitigation Strategy:  This anomaly will be addressed in the next release of RSLogix 5000, Version 20, and subsequent releases thereafter.  Additional recommendations to mitigate potential risk:  • Do not run RSLogix 5000 software in Administrator Mode. • Only open ACD files from known and trusted sources. • Store and transmit trusted ACD files in a secure manner and protect them as assets. • Consider digitally signing trusted ACD files to authenticate their origin and indicate any file tampering.  Note: RSLogix 5000 software does not include a means to digitally sign ACD files; however, there are commercially available tools that can be used such as PGP, GnuPG to apply signatures to ACD and other files.   To help further enhance overall control system security, Rockwell Automation also recommends the following strategies. When possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously:  1. Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and ControlNetworks. Refer to http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures. 2. Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment and perform product firmware upgrades to that equipment.  Rockwell Automation continues to investigate and evaluate other strategies such as product and system-level techniques and functional enhancements to enhance security and reduce the likelihood of file tampering.

Description

February 2, 2010 - Version 1.0
Rockwell Automation has identified a potential security vulnerability in the programming and configuration client software authentication mechanism employed by certain versions of the PLC5 and SLC family of programmable controllers. The particular vulnerability affects older versions the following catalog numbers: 1785-Lx and 1747-L5x (the ""Product""). Newer Products, programmed with current versions of RSLogix 5 or RSLogix 500, can enable specific security features like FactoryTalk Security services to effectively enhance security and reduce risks associated with this vulnerability. When coupled with contemporary network design practices, remaining risks linked to this vulnerability can be further reduced.
Details of this potential vulnerability to the affected Product are as follows:

The potential exists for a highly skilled, unauthorized person, with specific tools and know-how, to intercept the Product’s password over a communications link to potentially gain access and interrupt the Product’s intended operation.

Customers who are concerned about unauthorized access to their Products can take immediate steps as outlined below to reduce associated security risk from this potential vulnerability. These same steps can also serve as a checklist to verify available security capabilities are in place in a system configuration too.

For instance, to directly mitigate associated risk in PLC5 controllers, Rockwell Automation recommends use of the following mitigation strategy:

For PLC5 controllers, enable and configure ""Passwords and Privileges"" via RSLogix 5 configuration software to restrict access to critical data and improve overall password security.

To help further reduce the likelihood of exploitation and to help reduce associated security risk in the PLC5 and SLC family of controllers, Product users can follow these added remediation strategies (Note: when possible, multiple strategies should be employed simultaneously):

When applicable, upgrade Product firmware to a version that includes enhanced security functionality compatible with Rockwell Automation’s FactoryTalk Security services. This functionality can be enabled via RSLogix 5 or RSLogix 500 software. Recommended firmware revisions are as follows:

The 1747-L5x firmware should be OS Series C FRN 10, or higher.
