Intel Guidance for INTEL-SA-00828:
Intel determined this mitigation will be enabled by default in updated microcode. Users may be able to opt-out of the mitigation using hardware controls exposed by their OS/VMM, which can be used to avoid performance impact for affected workloads.  For most workloads, Intel has not observed reduced performance due to this mitigation. However, certain vectorization-heavy workloads may see some impact.
